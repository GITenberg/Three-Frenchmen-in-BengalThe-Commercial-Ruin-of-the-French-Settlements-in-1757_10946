<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br>
<p>This account of the commercial ruin of the French Settlements, taken
almost entirely from hitherto unpublished documents, originated as
follows. Whilst engaged in historical research connected with the
Government Records in Calcutta, I found many references to the
French in Bengal which interested me strongly in the personal side
of their quarrel with the English, but the information obtainable
from the Indian Records alone was still meagre and incomplete. A few
months ago, however, I came across Law's Memoir in the British
Museum; and, a little later, when visiting Paris to examine the
French Archives, I found not only a copy of Law's Memoir, but also
Renault's and Courtin's letters, of which there are, I believe, no
copies in England. In these papers I thought that I had sufficient
material to give something like an idea of Bengal as it appeared to
the French when Clive arrived there. There is much bitterness in
these old French accounts, and much misconception of the English,
but they were written when misconception of national enemies was the
rule and not the exception, and when the rights of non-belligerents
were little respected in time of war. Some of the accusations I have
checked by giving the English version, but I think that, whilst it
is only justice to our Anglo-Indian heroes to let the world know
what manner of men their opponents were, it is equally only justice
to their opponents to allow them to give their own version of the
story. This is my apology, if any one should think I allow them to
say too much.</p>
<p>The translations are my own, and were made in a state of some
perplexity as to how far I was bound to follow my originals&#8212;the
writings of men who, of course, were not literary, and often had not
only no pretension to style but also no knowledge of grammar. I have
tried, however, to preserve both form and spirit; but if any reader
is dissatisfied, and would like to see the original papers for
himself, the courtesy of the Record officials in both Paris and
London will give him access to an immense quantity of documents as
interesting as they are important.</p>
<p>In the various accounts that I have used there are naturally
slightly different versions of particular incidents, and often it is
not easy to decide which is the correct one. Under the
circumstances I may perhaps be excused for not always calling
attention to discrepancies which the reader will detect for himself.
He will also notice that the ground covered in one narrative is
partly traversed in one or both of the others. This has been due to
the necessity of treating the story from the point of view of each
of the three chief actors.</p>
<p>I may here mention that the correspondence between Clive and the
princes of Bengal, from which I have given some illustrative
passages, was first seen by me in a collection of papers printed in
1893 in the Government of India Central Printing Office, Calcutta,
under the direction of Mr. G.W. Forrest, C.I.E. These papers have
not yet been published, but there exists a complete though slightly
different copy of this correspondence in the India Office Library
(Orme MSS. India XI.), and it is from the latter copy that I have,
by permission, made the extracts here given. The remaining English
quotations, when not from printed books, have been taken chiefly
from other volumes of the Orme MSS., a smaller number from the
Bengal and Madras Records in the India Office, and a few from MSS.
in the British Museum or among the Clive papers at Walcot, to which
last I was allowed access by the kindness of the Earl of Powis.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish to express my thanks to M. Omont of the
Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale, Paris, to Mr. W. Foster of the Record Department of the
India Office, and to Mr. J.A. Herbert of the British Museum, for
their kind and valuable assistance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2>THE QUARREL WITH THE ENGLISH</h2>
<br>
<p>Writing in 1725, the French naval commander, the Chevalier d'Albert,
tells us that the three most handsome towns on the Ganges were
Calcutta, Chandernagore, and Chinsurah, the chief Factories of the
English, French, and Dutch. These towns were all situated within
thirty miles of each other. Calcutta, the latest founded, was the
greatest and the richest, owing partly to its situation, which
permitted the largest ships of the time to anchor at its quays, and
partly to the privilege enjoyed by the English merchants of trading
freely as individuals through the length and breadth of the land.
Native merchants and native artisans crowded to Calcutta, and the
French and Dutch, less advantageously situated and hampered by
restrictions of trade, had no chance of competing with the English
on equal terms. The same was of course true of their minor
establishments in the interior. All three nations had important
Factories at Cossimbazar (in the neighbourhood of Murshidabad, the
Capital of Bengal) and at Dacca, and minor Factories at Jugdea or
Luckipore, and at Balasore. The French and Dutch had also Factories
at Patna. Besides Calcutta, Chandernagore, and Chinsurah, the only
Factory which was fortified was the English Factory at Cossimbazar.</p>
<p>During the long reign of the usurper, Aliverdi Khan,<a name="1"></a><a
 href="#Note_1">[1]</a> that strong
and politic ruler enforced peace among his European guests, and
forbade any fortification of the Factories, except such as was
necessary to protect them against possible incursions of the
Marathas, who at that time made periodical attacks on Muhammadans
and Hindus alike to enforce the payment of the <i>chauth</i>,<a
 name="2"></a><a href="#Note_2">[2]</a> or
blackmail, which they levied upon all the countries within their
reach. In Southern India the English and French had been constantly
at war whenever there was war in Europe, but in Bengal the strength
of the Government, the terror of the Marathas, and the general
weakness of the Europeans had contrived to enforce a neutrality.
Still there was nothing to guarantee its continuance if the fear of
the native Government and of the Marathas were once removed, and if
any one of the three nations happened to find itself much stronger
than the others. The fear of the Marathas had nearly disappeared,
but that of the Government still remained. However, it was not till
more than sixty years after the foundation of Calcutta that there
appeared any possibility of a breach of peace amongst the Europeans
in Bengal. During this time the three Factories, Calcutta always
leading, increased rapidly in wealth and importance. To the
Government they were already a cause of anxiety and an object of
greed. Even during the life of Aliverdi Khan there were many of his
counsellors who advised the reduction of the status of Europeans to
that of the Armenians, i.e. mere traders at the mercy of local
officials; but Aliverdi Khan, whether owing to the enfeeblement of
his energies by age or to an intelligent recognition of the value of
European commerce, would not allow any steps to be taken against the
Europeans. Many stories are told of the debates in his <i>Durbar</i><a
 name="3"></a><a href="#Note_3">[3]</a>
on this subject: according to one, he is reported to have compared
the Europeans to bees who produce honey when left in peace, but
furiously attack those who foolishly disturb them; according to
another he compared them to a fire<a name="4"></a><a href="#Note_4">[4]</a>
which had come out of the sea
and was playing harmlessly on the shore, but which would devastate
the whole land if any one were so imprudent as to anger it. His
wisdom died with him, and in April, 1756, his grandson,
Siraj-ud-daula, a young man of nineteen,<a name="5"></a><a
 href="#Note_5">[5]</a> already notorious for
his debauchery and cruelty, came to the throne. The French&#8212;who, of
all Europeans, knew him best, for he seems to have preferred them to
all others&#8212;say his chief characteristics were cruelty, rapacity,
and cowardice. In his public speeches he seemed to be ambitious of
military fame. Calcutta was described to him as a strong fortress,
full of wealth, which belonged largely to his native subjects, and
inhabited by a race of foreigners who had grown insolent on their
privileges. As a proof of this, it was pointed out that they had not
presented him with the offerings which, according to Oriental
custom, are the due of a sovereign on his accession. The only
person who dared oppose the wishes of the young Nawab was his
mother,<a name="6"></a><a href="#Note_6">[6]</a> but her advice was of
no avail, and her taunt that he, a
soldier, was going to war upon mere traders, was equally
inefficacious. The records of the time give no definite information
as to the tortuous diplomacy which fanned the quarrel between him
and the English, but it is sufficiently clear that the English
refused to surrender the son of one of his uncle's <i>diwans</i>,<a
 name="7"></a><a href="#Note_7">[7]</a> who,
with his master's and his father's wealth, had betaken himself to
Calcutta. Siraj-ud-daula, by the treacherous promises of his
commanders, made himself master of the English Factory at
Cossimbazar without firing a shot, and on the 20th of June, 1756,
found himself in possession of Fort William, the fortified Factory
of Calcutta.<a name="8"></a><a href="#Note_8">[8]</a> The Governor, the
commandant<a name="9"></a><a href="#Note_9">[9]</a> of the troops, and
some two hundred persons of lesser note, had deserted the Fort
almost as soon as it was actually invested, and Holwell, one of the
councillors, an ex-surgeon, and the gallant few who stood by him and
continued the defence, were captured, and, to the number of 146,
cast into a little dungeon,<a name="10"></a><a href="#Note_10">[10]</a>
intended for military offenders,
from which, the next morning, only twenty-three came out alive. The
English took refuge at Fulta, thirty miles down the river, where the
Nawab, in his pride and ignorance, left them unmolested. There they
were gradually reinforced from Madras, first by Major Kilpatrick,
and later on by Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson. About the same
time both French and English learned that war had been declared in
Europe between England and France in the previous May, but, for
different reasons, neither nation thought the time suitable for
making the fact formally known.</p>
<p>Towards the end of December the English, animated by the desire of
revenge and of repairing their ruined fortunes, advanced on
Calcutta, and on the 2nd of January, 1757, the British flag again
floated over Fort William. The Governor, Manik Chand, was, like many
of the Nawab's servants, a Hindu. Some say he was scared away by a
bullet through his turban; others, that he was roused from the
enjoyment of a <i>nautch</i>&#8212;a native dance&#8212;by the news of the arrival
of the English.<a name="11"></a><a href="#Note_11">[11]</a> Hastening
to Murshidabad, he reported his
defeat, and asserted that the British they had now to deal with were
very different from those they had driven from or captured in
Calcutta.</p>
<p>The English were not satisfied with recovering Calcutta. They wished
to impress the Nawab, and so they sent a small force to Hugli, which
lies above Chandernagore and Chinsurah, stormed the Muhammadan fort,
burnt the town, and destroyed the magazines, which would have
supplied the Nawab's army in an attack on Calcutta. The inhabitants
of the country had never known anything so terrible as the big guns
of the ships, and the Nawab actually believed the men-of-war could
ascend the river and bombard him in his palace at Murshidabad.
Calling on the French and Dutch for aid, which they refused, he
determined to try his fortune a second time at Calcutta. At first,
everything seemed the same as on the former occasion: the native
merchants and artisans disappeared from the town; but it was not as
he thought, out of fear, but because the English wished to have them
out of the way, and so expelled them. Except for the military camp
to the north of the city, where Clive was stationed with his little
army, the town lay open to his attack. Envoys from Calcutta soon
appeared asking for terms, and the Nawab pretended to be willing to
negotiate in order to gain time while he outflanked Clive and seized
the town. Seeing through this pretence Watson and Clive thought it
was time to give him a lesson, and, on the morning of the 5th of
February, in the midst of a dense fog, Clive beat up his quarters.
Though Clive had to retire when the whole army was roused, the
slaughter amongst the enemy had been immense; and though he
mockingly informed the Nawab that he had been careful to "injure
none but those who got in his way," the Nawab himself narrowly
escaped capture. The action, however, was in no sense decisive. Most
of the Nawab's military leaders were eager to avenge their disgrace,
but some of the chief nobles, notably his Hindu advisers,
exaggerated the loss already incurred and the future danger, and
advised him to make peace. In fact, the cruelty and folly of the
Nawab had turned his Court into a nest of traitors. With one or two
exceptions there was not a man of note upon whom he could rely, and
he had not the wit to distinguish the faithful from the unfaithful.
Accordingly he granted the English everything they asked for&#8212;the
full restoration of all their privileges, and restitution of all
they had lost in the sack of Calcutta. As the English valued their
losses at several hundreds of thousands, and the Nawab had found
only some &pound;5000 in the treasury of Fort William, it is clear that
the wealth of Calcutta was either sunk in the Ganges or had fallen
as booty into the hands of the Moorish soldiers.</p>
<p>Siraj-ud-daula, though he did not yet know it, was a ruined man when
he returned to his capital. His only chance of safety lay in one of
two courses&#8212;either a loyal acceptance of the conditions imposed by
the English or a loyal alliance with the French against the English.
From the Dutch he could hope for nothing. They were as friendly to
the English as commercial rivals could be. They had always declared
they were mere traders and would not fight, and they kept their
word. After the capture of Calcutta the Nawab had exacted heavy
contributions from both the French and Dutch; but France and England
were now at war, and he thought it might be possible that in these
circumstances the restoration of their money to the French and the
promise of future privileges might win them to his side. He could
not, however, decide finally on either course, and the French were
not eager to meet him. They detested his character, and they
preferred, if the English would agree, to preserve the old
neutrality and to trade in peace. Further, they had received no
supplies of men or money for a long time; the fortifications of
Chandernagore, i.e. of Fort d'Orl&eacute;ans, were practically in
ruins,
and the lesser Factories in the interior were helpless. Their
military force, for attack, was next to nothing: all they could
offer was wise counsel and brave leaders. They were loth to offer
these to a man like the Nawab against Europeans, and he and his
Court were as loth to accept them. Unluckily for the French,
deserters from Chandernagore had served the Nawab's artillery when
he took Calcutta, and it was even asserted that the French had
supplied the Nawab with gunpowder; and so when the English heard of
these new negotiations, they considered the proposals for a
neutrality to be a mere blind; they forgot the kindness shown by the
French to English refugees at Dacca, Cossimbazar, and Chandernagore,
and determined that, as a permanent peace with the Nawab was out of
the question, they would, whilst he hesitated as to his course of
action, anticipate him by destroying the one element of force which,
if added to his power, might have made him irresistible. They
continued the negotiations for a neutrality on the Ganges only until
they were reinforced by a body of 500 Europeans from Bombay, when
they sent back the French envoys and exacted permission from the
Nawab to attack Chandernagore. Clive marched on that town with a
land force of 4000 Europeans and Sepoys, and Admiral Watson
proceeded up the river with a small but powerful squadron.</p>
<p>Thus began the ruin of the French in Bengal. The chief French
Factories were, as I have said, at Chandernagore, Cossimbazar, and
Dacca. The Chiefs of these Factories were M. Renault, the Director
of all the French in Bengal; M. Law, a nephew of the celebrated Law
of Lauriston, the financier; and M. Courtin. It is the doings and
sufferings of these three gallant men which are recorded in the
following chapters. They had no hope of being able to resist the
English by themselves, but they hoped, and actually believed, that
France would send them assistance if they could only hold out till
it arrived. Renault, whose case was the most desperate, perhaps
thought that the Nawab would, in his own interest, support him if
the English attacked Chandernagore; but knowing the Nawab as well as
he did, and reflecting that he had himself refused the Nawab
assistance when he asked for it, his hope must have been a feeble
one. Still he could not, with honour, give up a fortified position
without attempting a defence, and he determined to do his best. When
he failed, all that Law and Courtin could expect to do was to
maintain their personal liberty and create a diversion in the north
of Bengal when French forces attacked it in the south. It was not
their fault that the attack was never made.</p>
<p>I shall make no mention of the fate of the Factories at Balasore and
Jugdea. At these the number of Frenchmen was so very small that
resistance and escape were equally hopeless. Patna lay on the line
of Law's retreat, and, as we shall see, he was joined by the
second and other subordinate officers of that Factory. The chief, M.
de la Bretesche, was too ill to be moved, but he managed, by the
assistance of his native friends, to secure a large portion of the
property of the French East India Company, and so to finance Law
during his wanderings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>M. RENAULT, CHIEF OF CHANDERNAGORE</h2>
<br>
<p>The French East India Company was founded in 1664, during the
ministry of M. Colbert. Chandernagore, on the Ganges, or rather that
mouth of it now known as the River Hugli, was founded in 1676; and
in 1688 the town and territory were ceded to France by the Emperor
Aurengzebe. I know of no plan of Chandernagore in the 17th century,
and those of the 18th are extremely rare. Two or three are to be
found in Paris, but the destruction of the Fort and many of the
buildings by the English after its capture in 1757, and the decay of
the town after its restoration to the French, owing to diminished
trade, make it extremely difficult to recognize old landmarks. The
Settlement, however, consisted of a strip of land, about two leagues
in length and one in depth, on the right or western bank of the
Hugli. Fort d'Orl&eacute;ans lay in the middle of the river front. It
was
commenced in 1691, and finished in 1693.<a name="12"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_12">12</a>] Facing the north was
the Porte Royale, and to the east, or river-side, was the Water
Gate. The north-eastern bastion was known as that of the Standard,
or Pavillon. The north-western bastion was overlooked by the Jesuit
Church, and the south-eastern by the Dutch Octagon. This last
building was situated on one of a number of pieces of land which,
though within the French bounds, belonged to the Dutch before the
grant of the imperial charter, and which the Dutch had always
refused to sell. The Factory buildings were in the Fort itself. To
the west lay the Company's Tank, the hospitals, and the cemetery.
European houses, interspersed with native dwellings, lay all around.
M. d'Albert says that these houses were large and convenient, but
chiefly of one story only, built along avenues of fine trees, or
along the handsome quay. D'Albert also mentions a chapel in the
Fort,<a name="13"></a>[<a href="#Note_13">13</a>] the churches of the
Jesuits and the Capucins, and some
miserable <i>pagodas</i> belonging to the Hindus, who, owing to the
necessity of employing them as clerks and servants, were allowed the
exercise of their religion. In his time the Europeans numbered about
500. There were besides some 400 Armenians, Moors<a name="14"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_14">14</a>] and Topasses,
1400 to 1500 Christians, including slaves, and 18,000 to 20,000
Gentiles, divided, he says, into 52 different castes or occupations.
It is to be supposed that the European houses had improved in the
thirty years since d'Albert's visit; at any rate many of those which
were close to the Fort now commanded its interior from their roofs
or upper stories, exactly as the houses of the leading officials in
Calcutta commanded the interior of Fort William. No other fact could
be so significant of the security which the Europeans in Bengal
believed they enjoyed from any attack by the forces of the native
Government. The site of the Fort is now covered with native huts.
The Cemetery still remains and the Company's Tank (now known as Lal
Dighi), whilst Kooti Ghat is the old landing-place of Fort
d'Orleans.</p>
<p>As regards the European population at the time of the siege we have
no definite information. The Returns drawn up by the French
officials at the time of the capitulation do not include the women
and children or the native and mixed population. The ladies,<a name="15"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_15">15</a>] and
it is to be presumed the other women also, for there is no mention
of women during the siege, retired to the Dutch and Danish
settlements at Chinsurah and Serampore a few days before, and the
native population disappeared as soon as the British army
approached. The Returns therefore show only 538 Europeans and 66
Topasses. The Governor or Director, as already mentioned, was Pierre
Renault: his Council consisted of MM. Fournier, Caillot, Laporterie,
Nicolas, and Picques. There were 36 Frenchmen of lesser rank in the
Company's service, as well as 6 surgeons. The troops were commanded
by M. de Tury and 10 officers. There were also 10 officers of the
French East India Company's vessels, and 107 persons of sufficient
importance for their <i>parole</i> to be demanded when the Fort fell.
Apparently these Returns do not include those who were killed in the
defence, nor have we any definite information as to the number of
French sepoys, but Eyre Coote<a name="16"></a>[<a href="#Note_16">16</a>]
says there were 500.</p>
<p>The story of the siege is to be gathered from many accounts. M.
Renault and his Council submitted an official report; Renault wrote
many letters to Dupleix and other patrons or friends; several of the
Council and other private persons did the same.<a name="17"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_17">17</a>] M. Jean Law,
whose personal experiences we shall deal with in the next chapter,
was Chief of Cossimbazar, and watched the siege, as it were, from
the outside. His straightforward narrative helps us now and then to
correct a mis-statement made by the besieged in the bitterness of
defeat. On the English side, besides the Bengal records, there are
Clive's and Eyre Coote's military journals, the Logs of the British
ships of war, and the journal of Surgeon Edward Ives of His
Majesty's ship <i>Kent</i>. Thus this passage of arms, almost the only
one in Bengal<a name="18"></a>[<a href="#Note_18">18</a>] in which the
protagonists were Europeans, is no
obscure event, but one in which almost every incident was seen and
described from opposite points of view. This multiplicity of
authorities makes it difficult to form a connected narrative, and,
in respect to many incidents, I shall have to follow that account
which seems to enter into the fullest or most interesting detail.</p>
<p>It will now be necessary to go back a little. After the capture of
Calcutta in June, 1756, the behaviour of the Nawab to all Europeans
was so overbearing that Renault found it necessary to ask the
Superior Council of Pondicherry for reinforcements, but all that he
received was 67 Europeans and 167 Sepoys. No money was sent him, and
every day he expected to hear that war had broken out between
France and England.</p>

of these inquietudes, gentlemen, I was in the</span><br

cruel embarrassment, knowing not even what to</span><br

the excesses which he was committing against</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Europeans,
made me long for the arrival of the English in</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
Ganges to take vengeance for them. At the same time</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">I feared
the consequences of war being declared. In every</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">letter M.
de Leyrit<a name="19"></a>[<a href="#Note_19">19</a>] impressed upon me
the necessity of</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fortifying
Chandernagore as best I could, and of putting the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

state of security against a surprise, but you have</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">only to
look at Chandernagore to see how difficult it was for</span><br

absolutely destitute as we were of men and money, to do</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

a town open on all sides, and with nothing even to</span><br

off from the surrounding country."<a name="20"></a>[<a href="#Note_20">20</a>]</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>He goes on to describe Fort d'Orl&eacute;ans&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"almost
in the middle of the settlement, surrounded by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">houses,
which command it, a square of about 600 feet,<a name="21"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_21">21</a>]</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">built of
brick, flanked with four bastions, with six guns</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">each,
without ramparts or glacis. The southern curtain,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">about 4
feet thick, not raised to its full height, was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">provided
only with a battery of 3 guns; there was a similar</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">battery
to the west, but the rest of the west curtain was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">only a
wall of mud and brick, about a foot and a half thick,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and 8 or
10 feet high; there were warehouses ranged</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">against
the east curtain which faced the Ganges, and which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">was still
in process of construction; the whole of this side</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">had no
ditch, and that round the other sides was dry, only 4</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">feet in
depth, and a mere ravine. The walls of the Fort up</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to the
ramparts were 15 feet high, and the houses, on the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">edge of
the counterscarp, which commanded it, were as much</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">as 30
feet."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps the Fort was best defended on the west, where the Company's
Tank<a name="22"></a>[<a href="#Note_22">22</a>] was situated. Its bank
was only about twelve feet from the
Fort Ditch. This use of tanks for defensive purposes was an
excellent one, as they also provided the garrison with a good supply
of drinking water. A little later Clive protected his great barracks
at Berhampur with a line of large tanks along the landward side.
However, this tank protected one side only, and the task of holding
such a fort with an inadequate garrison was not a hopeful one even
for a Frenchman. It was only his weakness which had made Renault
submit to pay the contribution demanded by the Nawab on his
triumphant return from Calcutta in July of the previous year, and he
and his comrades felt very bitterly the neglect of the Company in
not sending money and reinforcements. One of his younger
subordinates wrote to a friend in Pondicherry:<a name="23"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_23">23</a>]&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"But
the 3-1/2 lahks that the Company has to pay to the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Nawab, is
that a trifle? Yes, my dear fellow, for I should</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">like it
to have to pay still more, to teach it how to leave</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">this
Factory, which is, beyond contradiction, the finest of its</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">settlements,
denuded of soldiers and munitions of war, so</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">that it
is not possible for us to show our teeth."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The wish was prophetic.</p>
<p>Like the English the French were forbidden by the Nawab to fortify
themselves. Renault dared not pay attention to this order. He had
seen what had happened to the English by the neglect of proper
precautions, and when things were at their worst, the Nawab had to
seek his alliance against the English, grant him leave to fortify
Chandernagore, and, later on, even to provide him with money under
the pretence that he was simply restoring the sum forcibly extorted
from him the previous year.<a name="24"></a>[<a href="#Note_24">24</a>]
Trade was at a standstill, and
Renault was determined that if the enemies of his nation were
destined to take the Company's property, they should have the utmost
difficulty possible in doing so. He expended the money on provisions
and ammunition. At the same time, that he might not lose any chance
of settling affairs peaceably with the English, he refused to
associate himself with the Nawab, and entered upon negotiations for
a neutrality in the Ganges. To protect himself if these failed, he
began raising fortifications and pulling down the houses which
commanded the Fort or masked its fire.</p>
<p>He could not pull down the houses on the south of the Fort, from
which Clive subsequently made his attack, partly for want of time,
partly because the native workmen ran away, and partly because of
the bad feeling prevalent in the motley force which formed his
garrison.<a name="25"></a>[<a href="#Note_25">25</a>] The most fatal
defect of all was the want of a
military engineer. The person who held that position had been sent
from France. He was a master mason, and had no knowledge of
engineering. It had been the same story in Calcutta. Drake's two
engineers had been a subaltern in the military and a young
covenanted servant. Renault had to supervise the fortifications
himself.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"I
commenced to pull down the church and the house</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
Jesuit fathers, situated on the edge of the Ditch, also</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">all the
houses of private persons which masked the entire</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">north
curtain. The wood taken from the ruins of these</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">served to
construct a barrier extending from bastion to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">bastion
and supporting this same north curtain, which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">seemed
ready to fall to pieces from old age."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This barrier was placed four feet outside the wall, the intervening
space being filled in with earth.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"Also
in front of Porte Royale" (i.e. outside the gate in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
avenue), "the weakest side of the Fort, I placed a battery</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of 3
guns, and worked hard at clearing out and enlarging</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
Ditch, but there was no time to make it of any use as a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">defence.
A warehouse on which I put bales of <i>gunny</i><a name="26"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_26">26</a>] to</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">prevent
cannon balls from breaking in the vaults of the roof,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">served it
as a casemate."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The east or river curtain was left alone. The French were, in fact,
so confident that the ships of war would not be able to force their
way up the river, and that Clive would not therefore think of
attacking on that side, that the only precaution they took at first
was the erection of two batteries outside the Fort. It is a
well-known maxim in war that one should attack at that point at
which the enemy deems himself most secure, and it will be seen that
all Clive's efforts were aimed at preparing for Admiral Watson to
attack on the east.</p>
<p>As regards artillery Renault was better off.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
alarm which the Prince" (Siraj-ud-daula) "gave us</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

last having given me reason to examine into the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">state of
the artillery, I found that not one of the carriages</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
guns on the ramparts was in a serviceable condition,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">not a
field-piece mounted, not a platform ready for the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">mortars.
I gave all my attention to these matters, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fortunately
had time to put them right."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>To serve his guns Renault had the sailors of the Company's ship,
<i>Saint Contest</i>, whose commander, M. de la Vigne Buisson, was the
soul of the defence.</p>
<p>About this time he received a somewhat doubtful increase to his
garrison, a crowd of deserters from the English East India Company's
forces. The latter at this time were composed of men of all
nationalities, English, Germans, Swiss, Dutch, and even French. Many
of them, and naturally the foreigners especially, were ready to
desert upon little provocation. The hardships of service in a
country where the climate and roads were execrable, where food and
pay were equally uncertain, and where promises were made not to be
kept, were provocations which the best soldiers might have found it
difficult to resist. We read of whole regiments in the English and
French services refusing to obey orders, and of mutinies of officers
as well as of men. The one reward of service was the chance of
plunder, and naturally, then, as soon as the fighting with the Nawab
had stopped for a time, the desertions from the British forces were
numerous. Colonel Clive had more than once written to Renault to
remonstrate with him for taking British soldiers into his service.
Probably Renault could have retorted the accusation with justice&#8212;at
any rate, he went on enlisting deserters; and from those who had now
come over he formed a company of grenadiers of 50 men, one of
artillery of 30, and one of sailors of 60, wisely giving them a
little higher pay than usual, "to excite their emulation." One of
these was a man named Lee,&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"a
corporal and a deserter from the <i>Tyger</i>, who pledged</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">himself

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">three
into the <i>Tyger</i>, but whilst he was bringing the mortars</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to bear
for that purpose, he was disabled by a musket bullet</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">from the <i>Kent's</i>
tops. He was afterwards sent home a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">prisoner
to England."<a name="27"></a>[<a href="#Note_27">27</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As might be expected the younger Frenchmen were wild with delight at
the chance of seeing a good fight. Some of them had been much
disappointed that the Nawab had not attacked Chandernagore in June,
1756. One of them wrote<a name="28"></a>[<a href="#Note_28">28</a>]&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"I
was charmed with the adventure and the chance</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of
carrying a musket, having always had" (what Frenchman</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">hasn't?)
"a secret leaning towards a military life. I</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">made, for
I was determined not to stand like a stock on a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">bastion,
where one only runs the risk of getting wounds</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">without
having any of the pleasure of inflicting them."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If not the highest form of military spirit, this was at any rate one
of which a good commander might make much use. Renault took
advantage of this feeling, and from the young men of the colony,
such as Company's servants, ships' officers, supercargoes, and
European inhabitants,<a name="29"></a>[<a href="#Note_29">29</a>] he
made a company of volunteers, to whom,
at their own request, he gave his son, an officer of the garrison,
as commander.</p>
<p>One of the volunteer officers writes:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"I
had the honour to be appointed lieutenant, and was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">much
pleased when I saw the spirit of emulation which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">reigned
in every heart. I cannot sufficiently praise the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">spirit of
exactitude with which every one was animated, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
progress which all made in so short a time in the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">management
of their arms. I lay stress on the fact that it</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">was an
occupation entirely novel to them, and one of which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
commencement always appears very hard, but they overcame</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">all

<p>All this time Renault was watching the war between the English and
the Moors. In January the English sailed up the Hugli, passed
Chandernagore contemptuously without a salute, burned the Moorish
towns of Hugli and Bandel, ravaged the banks of the river, and
retired to Calcutta. Up to this the Nawab had not condescended to
notice the English; now, in a moment of timidity, he asked the
intervention of the French as mediators.<a name="30"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_30">30</a>] Renault eagerly
complied, for had his mediation been accepted, he would have
inserted in the treaty a clause enforcing peace amongst the
Europeans in Bengal; but the English refused to treat through the
French. This could have only one meaning. Renault felt that his
course was now clear, and was on the point of offering the alliance
which the Nawab had so long sought for, when he received orders from
M. de Leyrit forbidding him to attack the English by land. As M. Law
writes, if Renault had been free to join the Nawab with 500
Europeans, either Clive would not have ventured a night attack on
the Nawab's camp, or, had he done so, the event would probably have
been very different. Under the circumstances, all that Renault could
do was to continue his fortifications. It was now that he first
realized that Admiral Watson would take part in the attack.</p>

established."<a name="31"></a>[<a href="#Note_31">31</a>]</span><br>

<p>It was this waste of valuable time upon the defence of the town that
a capable engineer would have saved Renault from the mistake of
committing. Had he limited his efforts to strengthening the walls of
the Fort and cleared away the surrounding houses, he would have been
not only stronger against the attack of the land force, but also in
a much better position to resist the ships.</p>
<p>The issue of the Nawab's attack on Calcutta has already been told.
He was so depressed by his failure that he now treated Renault with
the greatest respect, and it was now that he gave him the sum of
money&#8212;a lakh of rupees, then worth &pound;12,500&#8212;which he spent on
provisions and munitions of war. Renault says:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
Nawab's envoy further gave me to understand that</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">he was,

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to regard
them as his enemies. In spite of this we saw</span><br

from the treaty just made" (with the English)</span><br

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The Nawab and the English concluded a treaty of peace and alliance
on the 9th of February, 1757. Renault mentions no actual treaty
between the Nawab and the French, but the French doctor referred to
in a note above asserts that the Nawab demanded that the Council
should bind itself in writing,</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"to
oppose the passage of the English past Chandernagore....</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">It was
merely engaging to defend ourselves against</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
maritime force of the English ... because Chandernagore</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">was the
only place on this coast against which they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">could
undertake any enterprise by water. <i>This engagement</i></span><i
 style="font-family: courier new;"><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">was signed</span></i><span
 style="font-family: courier new;"> and sent to the Nawab three days
after he had</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">made
peace with the English. The Council received in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">reply two
privileges, the one to coin money with the King's</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">stamp at
Chandernagore, the other liberty of trade for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">individual
Frenchmen on the same footing as the Company,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and
100,000 rupees on account of the 300,000 which he had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">extorted
the previous year."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It does not matter whether this engagement was signed or not.<a
 name="32"></a>[<a href="#Note_32">32</a>] As
a Frenchman thus mentions it, the rumour of its signature must have
been very strong. It is probable that the English heard of it, and
believed it to be conclusive proof of the secret understanding
between the Nawab and the French. The privilege of individual trade
was particularly likely to excite their commercial jealousy, for it
was to this very privilege in their own case that the wealth and
strength of Calcutta were due. Such a rumour, therefore, was not
likely to facilitate negotiations. Nevertheless, Renault sent MM.
Fournier and Nicolas, the latter of whom had many friends amongst
the English, to Calcutta, to re-open the negotiations for a
neutrality. These negotiations seemed to be endless. The most
striking feature was Admiral Watson's apparent vacillation. When the
Council proposed war he wanted peace, when they urged neutrality he
wanted war. Clive went so far as to present a memorial to the
Council, saying it was unfair to continue the negotiations if the
Admiral was determined not to agree to a treaty. It seems as if the
Council wanted war, but wished to throw the responsibility upon the
Admiral. On the other hand the Admiral was only too eager to fight,
but hesitated to involve the Company in a war with the French and
the Nawab combined, at a moment when the British land forces were so
weakened by disease that success might be considered doubtful. He
had also to remember the fact that the Council at Chandernagore was
subordinate to the Council at Pondicherry, and the latter might,
whenever convenient to the French, repudiate the treaty. However, in
spite of all difficulties, the terms were agreed to, the draft was
prepared, and only the signatures were wanting, when a large
reinforcement of Europeans arrived from Bombay, and the Admiral
received formal notification of the declaration of war, and orders
from the Admiralty to attack the French.<a name="33"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_33">33</a>] This put an immediate
end to negotiations, and the envoys were instructed to return to
Chandernagore. At the same time the English determined to try and
prevent the Nawab from joining the French.</p>
<p>Whilst the Admiral was making up his mind fortune had favoured the
English. The Nawab, in fear of an invasion of Bengal by the Pathans,
had called upon the British for assistance, and on the 3rd of March
Clive's army left Calcutta <i>en route</i> for Murshidabad. The
Admiral
now pointed out to the Nawab that the British could not safely leave
Chandernagore behind them in the hands of an enemy, and Clive wrote
to the same effect, saying he would wait near Chandernagore for a
reply. On the 10th of March the Nawab wrote a letter to the Admiral,
which concluded with the following significant words:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"You
have understanding and generosity: if your enemy</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">with an
upright heart claims your protection, you will give</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">him life,
but then you must be <i>well</i> satisfied of the innocence</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of his
intentions: if not, whatever you think right, that do."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law says this letter was a forgery,<a name="34"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_34">34</a>] but as the Nawab did not
write any letters himself, the only test of authenticity was his
seal, which was duly attached. The English believed it to be
genuine, and the words quoted could have but one meaning. Admiral
Watson read them as a permission to attack the French without fear
of the Nawab's interference. He prepared to support Clive as soon as
the water in the Hugli would allow his ships to pass up, and, it
must be supposed, informed Clive of the letter he had received. At
any rate, he so informed the Council.</p>
<p>Clive reached Chandernagore on the 12th, and probably heard on that
day or the next from Calcutta. On the 13th he sent the following
summons&#8212;which Renault does not mention, and did not reply to&#8212;to
Chandernagore:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"SIR,</span><br

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It is important, in the light of what happened
later, to notice that Clive addresses Renault as a
combatant and the head of the garrison.</p>
<p>In England we have recently seen men eager to vilify their own
nation. France has produced similar monsters. One of them wrote from
Pondicherry:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
English having changed their minds on the arrival</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">prepared
to ransom themselves, and they would have</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">done so
at whatever price the ransom had been fixed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">provided
anything had remained to them. That mode of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">agreement
could not possibly suit the taste of the English.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">It was
rejected, and the Council of Chandernagore had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">no other
resource except to surrender on the best conditions</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">they
could obtain from the generosity of their enemy. This</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">course
was so firmly resolved upon that they gave no</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">thought
to defending themselves. The military insisted only</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">on firing
a single discharge, which they desired the Council</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">would
grant them. It was only the marine and the citizens</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">who,
though they had no vote in the Council, cried out</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">tumultuously
that the Fort must be defended. A plot was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">formed to
prevent the Director's son, who was ready to carry</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the keys
of the town to the English camp, from going out.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Suddenly
some one fired a musket. The English thought</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">it was
the reply to their summons. They commenced on</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">their
side to fire their artillery, and that was how a defence</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">which
lasted ten whole days was begun."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>How much truth is contained in the above paragraph may be judged by
what has been already stated. It will be sufficient to add that
Clive, receiving no answer to his summons, made a sudden attack on a
small earthwork to the south-west of the fort at 3 A.M. on the 14th
of March. For two whole days then, the English had been in sight of
Chandernagore without attacking. The French ladies had been sent to
Chinsurah and Serampore, so that the defenders had nothing to fear
on their account. Besides the French soldiers and civilians, there
were also about 2000 Moorish troops present, whom Law says he
persuaded the Nawab to send down as soon as the English left
Calcutta. Other accounts say that Renault hired them to assist him.
The Nawab had a strong force at Murshidabad ready to march under one
of his commanders, Rai Durlabh Ram; but the latter had experienced
what even a small English force could do in the night attack on the
Nawab's camp, and was by no means inclined to match himself a second
time against Clive; accordingly, he never got further than five
leagues from Murshidabad. Urgent messages were sent from
Chandernagore as soon as the attack began. M. Law begged of the
Nawab to send reinforcements. Mr. Watts, the English Chief, and all
his party in the <i>Durbar</i>, did their utmost to prevent any orders
being issued. The Nawab gave orders which he almost immediately
countermanded. Renault ascribes this to a letter which he says
Clive wrote on the 14th of March, the very day of the attack,
promising the Nawab to leave the French alone, but it is not at all
likely that he did so. It is true Clive had written to this effect
on the 22nd of February; but since then much had happened, and he
was now acting, as he thought and said, with the Nawab's permission.
On the 16th of March he wrote to Nand Kumar, Faujdar<a name="35"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_35">35</a>] of Hugli,
as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The

(tho' I thank God they have proved in vain, since</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">but I
could no longer stifle my resentment when I found</span><br

under promise of great rewards from the French</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

them against us; I should be sorry, at a time when</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

happy in his Excellency's favour and friendship, that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

do any injury to his servants; I am therefore to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">desire
you will send these forces an order to withdraw, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">that no
other may come to their assistance."<a name="37"></a>[<a href="#Note_37">37</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>What Clive feared was that, though the
Nawab might not interfere openly, some of his
servants might receive secret orders to do so, and
on the 22nd of March he wrote even more curtly
to Rai Durlabh himself:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"I
hear you are arrived within 20 miles of Hughly.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Whether
you come as a friend or an enemy, I know not. If</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">as the
latter, say so at once, and I will send some people out</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to fight
you immediately.... Now you know my mind."<a name="38"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_38">38</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When diplomatic correspondence was conducted in letters of this
kind, it is easy to understand that the Nawab was frightened out of
his wits, and absolutely unable to decide what course he should
take. There was little likelihood of the siege being influenced by
anything he might do.</p>
<p>The outpost mentioned as the object of the first attack was a small
earthwork, erected at the meeting of three roads. It was covered by
the Moorish troops, who held the roofs of the houses around. As the
intention of the outposts was merely to prevent the town from being
surprised, and to enable the inhabitants to take shelter in the
Fort, the outpost ought to have been withdrawn as quickly as
possible, but, probably because they thought it a point of honour to
make a stout defence wherever they were first attacked, the
defenders stood to it gallantly. Renault sent repeated
reinforcements, first the company of grenadiers, then at 9 o'clock
the company of artillery, and at 10 o'clock, when the surrounding
houses were in flames, and many of the Moors had fled, a company of
volunteers. With these, and a further reinforcement of sixty
sailors, the little fort held out till 7 o'clock in the evening,
when the English, after three fruitless assaults, ceased fire and
withdrew. Street fighting is always confusing, and hence the
following vague description of the day's events from Captain Eyre
Coote's journal:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"Colonel
Clive ordered the picquets, with the company's</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">grenadiers,

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">with an
old ditch,<a name="39"></a>[<a href="#Note_39">39</a>] the entrance

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Lynn, and
send him word after we had reconnoitred the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">place. On
our arrival there we found a party of French was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in
possession of a road leading to a redoubt that they had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">thrown up
close under their fort, where they had a battery</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of
cannon, and upon our advancing down the road, they fired</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">some
shots at us. We detached some parties through a wood,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and drove
them from the road into their batteries with the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">loss of
some men; we then sent for the Colonel, who, as soon</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">as he
joined us, sent to the camp for more troops. We</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">continued
firing at each other in an irregular manner till</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">about
noon, at which time the Colonel ordered me to continue</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">with my
grenadier company and about 200 sepoys at the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">advance
post, and that he would go with the rest of our</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">troops to
the entrance, which was about a mile back. About</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">2 o'clock
word was brought me that the French were making</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">a sortie.
Soon after, I perceived the sepoys retiring from</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">their
post, upon which I sent to the Colonel to let him know</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
French were coming out. I was then obliged to divide</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">my
company, which consisted of about 50 men, into 2 or 3</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">parties
(very much against my inclination) to take possession</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
ground the sepoys had quitted. We fired pretty</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">warmly
for a quarter of an hour from the different parties</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">at each
other, when the French retreated again into their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">battery.
On this occasion I had a gentleman (Mr. Tooke<a name="40"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_40">40</a>]),</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">who was a
volunteer, killed, and 2 of my men wounded.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">The enemy
lost 5 or 6 Europeans and some blacks. I got</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">close
under the battery, and was tolerably well sheltered by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">an old
house, where I continued firing till about 7 o'clock,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">at which
time I was relieved, and marched back to camp."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>The defenders were much exhausted, as well by the fighting as by the
smoke and heat from the burning houses and the heat of the weather,
for it was almost the hottest season of the year. It seemed probable
that the English would make another attack during the night, and as
the defenders already amounted to a very large portion of the
garrison, it was almost impossible to reinforce them without
leaving the Fort itself in great danger, if Clive managed to
approach it from any other quarter. Renault called a council of war,
and, after taking the opinion of his officers in writing to the
effect that the outposts must be abandoned, he withdrew the
defenders at 9 o'clock, under cover of the darkness: The French had
suffered a loss of only 10 men killed and wounded. Clive mentions
that, at the same time, all the other outposts and batteries, except
those on the river side, were withdrawn.</p>
<p>Mustering his forces in the Fort, Renault found them to be composed
of 237 soldiers (of whom 117 were deserters from the British), 120
sailors, 70 half-castes and private Europeans, 100 persons employed
by the Company, 167 Sepoys and 100 <i>Topasses</i>. Another French
account puts the total of the French garrison at 489, but this
probably excludes many of the private people.<a name="41"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_41">41</a>]</p>
<p>On the 15th the English established themselves in the town, and
drove out the Moors who had been stationed on the roofs of the
houses. This gave them to some extent the command of the interior of
the Fort, but no immediate attack was made on the latter. A French
account<a name="42"></a>[<a href="#Note_42">42</a>] says this was
because&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"all
their soldiers were drunk with the wine they had found</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in the
houses. Unfortunately we did not know of this. It</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">would
have been the moment to make a sortie, of which the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">results
must have been favourable to us, the enemy being</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">incapable
of defence."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>During the night of the 15th the Fort was bombarded, and on the
morning of the 16th the British completed the occupation of the
houses deserted by the Moors. The latter not being received into the
Fort, either fled or were sent away. They betook themselves to Nand
Kumar, the Faujdar of Hugli, announcing the capture of the town.
Nand Kumar, who is said to have had an understanding with the
British, sent on the message to Rai Durlabh and the Nawab, with the
malicious addition that the Fort, if it had not already fallen,
would fall before Rai Durlabh could reach it. This put an end to all
chance of the Nawab interfering.</p>
<p>The French spent the day in blocking a narrow passage formed by a
sandbank in the river, a short distance below the town. They sank&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"four
large ships and a hulk,... and had a chain and boom</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">across in
order to prevent our going up with the squadron.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Captain
Toby sent his 2nd lieutenant, Mr. Bloomer, that night,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">who cut
the chain and brought off a sloop that buoyed it up."<a name="43"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_43">43</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It was apparently this rapid attack on the position that accounts
for the timidity of the pilots and boatmen, who, Renault tells us,
hurried away without staying to sink two other ships which were half
laden, and which, if sunk, would have completely blocked the
passage. Even on the ships which were sunk the masts had been left
standing, so as to point out their position to the enemy.</p>
<p>Besides the ships sunk in the passage, there were at Chandernagore
the French East Indiaman the <i>Saint Contest</i> (Captain de la Vigne
Buisson), four large ships, and several small ones. The French
needed all the sailors for the Fort, so they sank all the vessels
they could not send up the river except three, which it was supposed
they intended to use as fire-ships.</p>
<p>Clive, in the meantime, was advancing cautiously, his men erecting
batteries, which seemed to be very easily silenced by the superior
gunnery of the Fort. His object was partly to weary out the garrison
by constant fighting, and partly to creep round to the river face,
so as to be in a position to take the batteries which commanded the
narrow river passage, as soon as Admiral Watson was ready to attack
the Fort. Later on, the naval officers asserted he could not have
taken the Fort without the assistance of the fleet. He said he
could, and it is certain that if he had had no fleet to assist him
his mode of attack would have been a very different one.</p>
<p>Early in the siege the French were warned from Chinsurah to beware
of treachery amongst the deserters in their pay, and on the 17th of
March a number of arrows were found in the Fort with labels
attached, bearing the words:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"Pardon
to deserters who will rejoin their colours, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">rewards
to officers who will come over to us."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>These were seized by the officers before the men could see them, but
one of the officers themselves, Charles Cossard de Terraneau, a
sub-lieutenant of the garrison, took advantage of the offer to go
over to the English. This officer had served with credit in the
South of India, and had lost an arm in his country's service. The
reason of his desertion is said to have been a quarrel with M.
Renault. M. Raymond, the translator of a native history of the time
by Gholam Husain Khan,<a name="44"></a>[<a href="#Note_44">44</a>]
tells a story of De Terraneau which seems
improbable. It is to the effect that he betrayed the secret of the
river passage to Admiral Watson, and that a few years later he sent
home part of the reward of his treachery to his father in France.
The old man returned the money with indignant comments on his son's
conduct, and De Terraneau committed suicide in despair. As a matter
of fact, De Terraneau was a land officer,<a name="45"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_45">45</a>] and therefore not
likely to be able to advise the Admiral, who, as we shall see,
solved the riddle of the passage in a perfectly natural manner, and
the Probate Records show that De Terraneau lived till 1765, and in
his will left his property to his wife Ann, so the probability is
that he lived and died quietly in the British service. His only
trouble seems to have been to get himself received by his new
brother officers. However, he was, so Clive tells us, the only
artillery officer the French had, and his desertion was a very
serious matter. Renault writes:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
same night, by the improved direction of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">besiegers'
bombs, I had no doubt but that he had done us</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">a bad
service."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>On the 18th the French destroyed a battery which the English had
established near the river, and drove them out of a house opposite
the south-east bastion. The same day the big ships of the
squadron&#8212;the <i>Kent</i> (Captain Speke), the <i>Tyger</i> (Captain
Latham),
and the <i>Salisbury</i> (Captain Martin), appeared below the town.
The
<i>Bridgewater</i> and <i>Kingfisher</i> had come up before. Admiral
Watson
was on board the <i>Kent</i>, and Admiral Pocock on the <i>Tyger</i>.
The
fleet anchored out of range of the Fort at the Prussian Gardens, a
mile and a half below the town, and half a mile below the narrow
passage in which the ships had been sunk.</p>
<p>On the 19th Admiral Watson formally announced the declaration of
war,<a name="46"></a>[<a href="#Note_46">46</a>] and summoned the Fort
to surrender. The Governor called a
council of war, in which there was much difference of opinion. Some
thought the Admiral would not have come so far without his being
certain of his ability to force the passage; indeed the presence of
so many deserters in the garrison rendered it probable that he had
secret sources of information. As a matter of fact, it was only when
Lieutenant Hey, the officer who had brought the summons, and, in
doing so, had rowed between the masts of the sunken vessels,
returned to the <i>Kent</i>, that Admiral Watson knew the passage was
clear. Renault and the Council were aware that the Fort could not
resist the big guns of the ships, and accordingly the more
thoughtful members of the council of war determined, if possible, to
try and avoid fighting by offering a ransom. This apparently gave
rise to the idea that they wished to surrender, and an English
officer says:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"Upon
the Admiral's sending them a summons ... to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">surrender,
they were very stout; they gave us to understand</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">there
were two parties in the Factory, the Renaultions and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
anti-Renaultions. The former, which they called the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">great-wigg'd
gentry, or councillors, were for giving up the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Fort, but
the others vowed they would die in the breach. To</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">these
high and lofty expressions the Admiral could give no</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">other
answer than that in a very few days, or hours perhaps,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">he would
give them a very good opportunity of testifying</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">their
zeal for the Company and the Grand Monarque."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The offer of ransom was made, and was refused by the Admiral.
Renault says, he&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"insisted
on our surrendering and the troops taking possession</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
Fort, <i>promising, however, that every one should keep his</i></span><i
 style="font-family: courier new;"><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">own property</span></i><span
 style="font-family: courier new;">. There was not a man amongst us who
did not</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">prefer to
run the risk of whatever might happen to surrendering</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in this
fashion, without the Fort having yet suffered any</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">material
damage, and every one was willing to risk his own</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">interests
in order to defend those of the Company. Every</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">one swore
to do his best."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The Admiral could not attack at once, owing to the state of the
river, but to secure his own position against any counter-attack,
such as was very likely with a man like Captain de la Vigne in the
Fort, he sent up boats the same night, and sank the vessels which it
was supposed the French intended to use as fire-ships; and the next
day Mr. John Delamotte, master of the <i>Kent</i>, under a heavy fire,
sounded and buoyed the passage for the ships.</p>
<p>The army, meanwhile, continued its monotonous work ashore, the
soldiers building batteries for the French to knock to pieces, but
succeeding in Clive's object, which was "to keep the enemy
constantly awake."<a name="47"></a>[<a href="#Note_47">47</a>]
Sometimes this work was dangerous, as, for
instance, on the 21st, when a ball from the Fort knocked down a
verandah close to one of the English batteries, "the rubbish of
which choked up one of our guns, very much bruised two artillery
officers, and buried several men in the ruins."<a name="48"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_48">48</a>]</p>
<p>By the 22nd Clive had worked his way round to the river, and was
established to the north-east and south-east of the Fort so as to
assist the Admiral, and on the river the Admiral had at last got the
high tide he was waiting for. Surgeon Ives tells the story as
follows:<a name="49"></a>[<a href="#Note_49">49</a>]&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
Admiral the same evening ordered lights to be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">placed on

 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">blinds
towards the Fort, that we might see how to pass</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">between
them a little before daylight, and without being</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">

take off the fire of the Fort when the ships passed</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">up, began
firing away, and had almost battered down the</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">got very
well into her station against the north-east bastion.</span><br

with Admiral Watson's flag flying, quickly followed</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">her, but
before she could reach her proper station, the tide of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">ebb
unfortunately made down the river, which occasioned her</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">anchor to
drag, so that before she brought up she had fallen</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">abreast
of the south-east bastion, the place where the <i>Salisbury</i></span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">should
have been, and from her mainmast aft she was exposed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to the
flank guns of the south-west bastion also. The accident</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the <i>Kent's</i>
anchor not holding fast, and her driving down</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">into the <i>Salisbury's</i>
station, threw this last ship out of action,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to the
great mortification of the captain, officers, and crew,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">for she
never had it in her power to fire a gun, unless it was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">now and
then, when she could sheer on the tide. The French,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">during
the whole time of the <i>Kent</i> and <i>Tyger's</i> approach</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">towards
the Fort, kept up a terrible cannonade upon them,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">without
any resistance on their part; but as soon as the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">ships
came properly to an anchor they returned it with such</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fury as
astonished their adversaries. Colonel Clive's troops</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">at the
same time got into those houses which were nearest</span><br

and from thence greatly annoyed the enemy with</span><br

musketry. Our ships lay so near to the Fort that the</span><br

 name="51"></a>[<a href="#Note_51">51</a>] walls of the Governor's palace,
which was in</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the very
centre of the Fort, were beaten as flat as a half-crown.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">The fire
now became general on both sides, and was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">kept up
with extraordinary spirit. The flank guns of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">south-west
bastion galled the <i>Kent</i> very much, and the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Admiral's
aide-de-camps being all wounded, Mr. Watson went</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">down
himself to Lieutenant William Brereton, who commanded</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the lower
deck battery, and ordered him particularly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to direct
his fire against those guns, and they were accordingly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">soon
afterwards silenced. At 8 in the morning</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">several
of the enemy's shot struck the <i>Kent</i> at the same</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">time; one
entered near the foremast, and set fire to two or</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">three
32-pound cartridges of gunpowder, as the boys held</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">them in
their hands ready to charge the guns. By the explosion,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
wad-nets and other loose things took fire between</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">decks,
and the whole ship was so filled with smoke that the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">men, in
their confusion, cried out she was on fire in the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">gunner's
store-room, imagining from the shock they had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">felt from
the balls that a shell had actually fallen into her.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">This
notion struck a panic into the greater part of the crew,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and 70 or
80 jumped out of the port-holes into the boats</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">that were
alongside the ship. The French presently saw</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">this
confusion on board the <i>Kent</i>, and, resolving to take the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">advantage,
kept up as hot a fire as possible upon her during</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the whole
time. Lieutenant Brereton, however, with the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">assistance
of some other brave men, soon extinguished the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fire, and
then running to the ports, he begged the seamen to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">come in
again, upbraiding them for deserting their quarters;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">but
finding this had no effect upon them, he thought the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">more
certain method of succeeding would be to strike them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">with a
sense of shame, and therefore loudly exclaimed, 'Are</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">you
Britons? You Englishmen, and fly from danger? For</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">shame!
For shame!' This reproach had the desired effect;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to a man
they immediately returned into the ship, repaired</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to their
quarters, and renewed a spirited fire on the enemy.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"In about
three hours from the commencement of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">attack
the parapets of the north and south bastions were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">almost
beaten down; the guns were mostly dismounted, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">we could
plainly see from the main-top of the <i>Kent</i> that the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">ruins
from the parapet and merlons had entirely blocked up</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">those few
guns which otherwise might have been fit for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">service.
We could easily discern, too, that there had been</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">a great
slaughter among the enemy, who, finding that our</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fire
against them rather increased, hung out the white flag,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">whereupon
a cessation of hostilities took place, and the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Admiral
sent Lieutenant Brereton (the only commissioned</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">officer
on board the <i>Kent</i> that was not killed or wounded)</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and
Captain Coote of the King's regiment with a flag of truce</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to the
Fort, who soon returned, accompanied by the French</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Governor's
son, with articles of capitulation, which being</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">settled
by the Admiral and Colonel, we soon after took possession</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
place."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>So far then from the besiegers' side; Renault's description of the
fight is as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
three largest vessels, aided by the high-water of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
equinoctial tides, which, moreover, had moved the vessels</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">sunk in
the narrow passage, passed over the sunken ships,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">which did
not delay them for a moment, to within half</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">pistol
shot of the Fort, and opened fire at 6 a.m. Then the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">troops in
the battery on the bank of the Ganges, who had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">so far
fired only one discharge, suddenly found themselves</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">overwhelmed
with the fire from the tops of the ships,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">abandoned
it, and had much difficulty in gaining the Fort....</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">I
immediately sent the company of grenadiers, with a detachment</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of the
artillery company as reinforcements, to the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">south-eastern
bastion and the Bastion du Pavillon, which two</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">bastions
face the Ganges; but those troops under the fire of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the
ships, joined to that of the land batteries, <i>rebuilt the</i></span><i
 style="font-family: courier new;"><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">same night</span></i><span
 style="font-family: courier new;">, and of more than 3000 men placed
on the roofs</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">of houses
which overlooked the Fort, almost all took flight,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">leaving
two of their officers behind, one dead and the other</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">wounded.
I was obliged to send immediately all the marine</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">and the
inhabitants from the other posts.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
attack was maintained with vigour from 6 a.m. to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">10.30,
when all the batteries were covered with dead and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">wounded,
the guns dismounted, and the merlons destroyed,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in spite
of their being strengthened with bales of cloth. No</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">one could
show himself on the bastions, demolished by the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">fire of
more than 100 guns; the troops were terrified during</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">this
attack by the loss of all the gunners and of nearly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">200 men;
the bastions were undermined, and threatened to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">crumble
away and make a breach, which the exhaustion of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">our
people, and the smallness of the number who remained,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">made it
impossible for us to hope to defend successfully.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Not a
soldier would put his hand to a gun; it was only the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">European
marine who stood to their duty, and half of these</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">were
already killed or disabled. A body of English troops,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">lying
flat on the ground behind the screen which we had commenced</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to erect
on the bank of the Ganges, was waiting the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">signal to
attack. Seeing the impossibility of holding out longer,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">I thought
that in the state in which the Fort was I could not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in
prudence expose it to an assault. Consequently I hoisted</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the white
flag and ordered the drums to beat a parley."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>According to an account written later by a person who was not
present at the siege, Renault lost his Fort by a quarter of an hour.
This writer says the tide was rapidly falling, and, had the eastern
defences of the Fort been able to resist a little longer, the ships
would have found their lower tiers of guns useless, and might have
been easily destroyed by the French. Suppositions of this kind
always suppose a stupidity on the part of the enemy which Renault
had no right to count upon. Admiral Watson must have known the
strength of the fortress he was about to attack before he placed
his ships in a position from which it would be impossible to
withdraw them whenever he wished to do so.</p>
<p>The flag of truce being displayed, Captain Eyre Coote was sent
ashore, and returned in a quarter of an hour with the Governor's son
bearing "a letter concerning the delivery of the place." Articles
were agreed upon, and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon Captain
Coote, with a company of artillery and two companies of grenadiers,
took possession of the Fort. Before this took place there occurred
an event the consequences of which were very unfortunate for the
French. Everything was in a state of confusion, and the deserters,
who formed the majority of the garrison, expecting no mercy from the
Admiral and Clive, determined to escape. Rushing tumultuously to the
Porte Royale, their arms in their hands, they forced it to be opened
to them, and, finding the northern road to Chinsurah unguarded, made
the best of their way in that direction. They were accompanied by a
number of the military and marine, as well as by some of the
Company's servants and private persons who were determined not to
surrender. As all this took place after the hoisting of the white
flag and pending the conclusion of the capitulation, the English
considered it a breach of the laws of warfare, and when later on
the meaning of the capitulation itself was contested they absolutely
refused to listen to any of the representations of the French. In
all about 150 persons left the Fort. They had agreed to reassemble
at a place a little above Hugli. The English sent a small force
after them, who shot some and captured others, but about 80 officers
and men arrived at the rendezvous in safety. The pursuit, however,
was carried further, and Law writes:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"Constantly
pursued, they had to make forced marches.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Some lost
their way; others, wearied out, were caught as they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">stopped
to rest themselves. However, when I least expected</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">it, I was
delighted to see the officers and many of the soldiers</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">arrive in
little bands of 5 and 6, all naked, and so worn out</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">that they
could hardly hold themselves upright. Most of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">them had
lost their arms."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This reinforcement increased Law's garrison from 10 or 12 men to 60,
and secured the safety of his person, but the condition of the
fugitives must have been an object lesson to the Nawab and his
<i>Durbar</i> which it was not wise for the French to set before them.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The escape of the French from Chandernagore is of interest, as it
shows the extraordinary condition of the country. It is probable
that the peasantry and gentry were indifferent as to whether the
English or the French were victorious, whilst the local authorities
were so paralyzed by the Nawab's hesitation that they did not know
which side to assist. Later on we shall find that small parties, and
even solitary Frenchmen, wandered through the country with little or
no interference, though the English had been recognized as the
friends and allies of the new Nawab, Mir Jafar.</p>
<p>To return, however, to Renault and the garrison of Chandernagore.
The capitulation proposed by Renault and the Admiral's answers were
to the following effect:&#8212;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The lives of the deserters to be
spared. <i>Answer</i>. The deserters
to surrender absolutely.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Officers of the garrison to be
prisoners on parole, and allowed
to keep their effects. <i>Answer</i>. Agreed to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. Soldiers of the garrison to be
prisoners of war. <i>Answer</i>. Agreed
to, on condition that foreigners may enter the English service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4. Sepoys of the garrison to be set free.
<i>Answer</i>. Agreed to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5. Officers and crew of the French
Company's ship to be sent to
Pondicherry. <i>Answer</i>. These persons to be prisoners of war
according to articles 2 and 3.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6. The Jesuit fathers to be allowed to
practise their religion and
retain their property. <i>Answer</i>. No European to be allowed to
remain
at Chandernagore, but the fathers to be allowed to retain their
property.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">7. All inhabitants to retain their
property. <i>Answer</i>. This to be
left to the Admiral's sense of equity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">8. The French Factories up-country to be
left in the hands of their
present chiefs. <i>Answer</i>. This to be settled by the Nawab and the
Admiral.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">9. The French Company's servants to go
where they please, with their
clothes and linen. <i>Answer</i>. Agreed to.</p>
<p>It is evident that the capitulation was badly drawn up. Civilians
who had taken part in the defence, as had all the Company's
servants, might be justly included in the garrison, and accordingly
Admiral Watson and Clive declared they were all prisoners of war,
and that article 9 merely permitted them to reside where they
pleased on <i>parole</i>. On the other hand, Renault and the French
Council declared that, being civilians, nothing could make them part
of the garrison, and therefore under article 9 they might do what
they pleased. Accordingly, they expressed much surprise when they
were stopped at the Fort gates by one of Clive's officers, and
forced to sign, before they were allowed to pass, a paper promising
not to act against Britain directly or indirectly during the course
of the war.</p>
<p>Another point of difficulty was in reference to article 7. The town
had been in the hands of the British soldiers and sepoys for days.
Much had been plundered, and both soldiers and sailors were wild for
loot. They considered that the Admiral was acting unjustly to them
in restoring their property to civilians who had been offered the
chance of retaining it if they would avoid unnecessary bloodshed by
a prompt surrender. Instead of this, the defence was so desperate
that one officer writes:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Clive's total loss was only about 40 men killed and wounded, but
the loss on the ships was so great, that before the Fort surrendered
the besiegers had lost quite as many men as the besieged, and it was
by no means clear to the common mind what claim the French had to
leniency. Even English officers wrote:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The

<p>The result was that the soldiers on guard began to beat the coolies
who were helping the French to secure their goods, until they were
induced by gifts to leave them alone, and much plundering went on
when the soldiers could manage to escape notice. On one day three
black soldiers were executed, and on another Sergeant Nover<a name="55"></a>[<a
 href="#Note_55">55</a>] and
a private soldier of the 39th Regiment were condemned to death, for
breaking open the Treasury and stealing 3000 rupees. Another theft,
which was not traced, was the holy vessels and treasure of the
Church.</p>
<p>Many individual Frenchmen were ruined. Of one of these Surgeon Ives
narrates the following pleasing incident:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"It
happened unfortunately ... that Monsieur Nicolas,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">a man of
most amiable character, and the father of a large</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">family,
had not been so provident as the rest of his countrymen</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in
securing his effects within the Fort, but had left them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in the
town; consequently, upon Colonel Clive's first taking</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">possession
of the place, they had all been plundered by our</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">common
soldiers; and the poor gentleman and his family</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">were to
all appearance ruined. The generous and humane</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Captain
Speke,<a name="56"></a>[<a href="#Note_56">56</a>] having heard of the
hard fate of Monsieur</span><br style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Nicolas,
took care to represent it to the two admirals in all</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">its
affecting circumstances, who immediately advanced the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">sum of
1500 rupees each. Their example was followed by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">the five
captains of the squadron, who subscribed 5000</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">between
them. Mr. Doidge added 800 more, and the same</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">sum was
thrown in by another person who was a sincere well-wisher</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">to this
unfortunate gentleman; so that a present of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">9600
rupees, or &pound;1200 sterling was in a few minutes collected</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">towards
the relief of this valuable Frenchman and his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">distressed
family. One of the company was presently</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">despatched
with this money, who had orders to acquaint</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Monsieur
Nicolas that a few of his English friends desired</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">his
acceptance of it, as a small testimony of the very high</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">esteem
they had for his moral character, and of their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">unfeigned
sympathy with him in his misfortunes. The poor</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">gentleman,
quite transported by such an instance of generosity</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">in an
enemy, cried out in a sort of ecstasy, 'Good God,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">they axe
friends indeed!' He accepted of the present with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">great
thankfulness, and desired that his most grateful</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">acknowledgements
might be made to his unknown benefactors,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">for whose
happiness and the happiness of their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">families,
not only his, but the prayers of his children's</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">children,
he hoped, would frequently be presented to heaven.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">He could
add no more; the tears, which ran plentifully down</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">his
cheeks, bespoke the feelings of his heart: and, indeed,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">implied
much more than even Cicero with all his powers of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">oratory
could possibly have expressed."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This, however, was but a solitary instance; the state of the French
was, as a rule, wretched in the extreme, and Renault wrote:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The

being caused by the misery to which our countrymen</span><br

reduced, their poverty, which I cannot relieve,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">draws
tears from my eyes, the more bitter that I have seen</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">them risk
their lives so generously for the interests of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Company,
and of our nation."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In such circumstances there was but one consolation possible to
brave men&#8212;the knowledge that, in the eyes of friend and foe, they
had done their duty. The officers of the British army and navy all
spoke warmly of the gallant behaviour of the French, and the
historian Broome, himself a soldier and the chronicler of many a
brave deed, expresses himself as follows:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">"The
conduct of the French on this occasion was most</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">creditable
and well worthy the acknowledged gallantry of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">that
nation. Monsieur Renault, the Governor, displayed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">great
courage and determination: but the chief merit of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">defence
was due to Monsieur Devignes" (Captain de la</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">Vigne
Buisson), "commander of the French Company's ship,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;"><i>Saint
Contest</i>. He took charge of the bastions, and directed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">their
fire with great skill and judgment, and by his own</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">example
inspired energy and courage into all those around</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new;">him."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Renault himself found some consolation in the gallant behaviour of
his sons.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"In
my misfortune I have had the satisfaction to see my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

sons distinguish themselves in the siege with all the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">courage
and intrepidity which I could desire. The elder</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">brother

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">volunteer;
the younger, an officer in the army, was, as has</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">been
said above, commandant of the volunteers."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Others who are mentioned by Renault and his companions as having
distinguished themselves on the French side, were the Councillors
MM. Caillot, Nicolas, and Picques, Captain de la Vigne Buisson and
his son and officers, M. Sinfray (secretary to the Council), the
officers De Kalli<a name="57"></a>[<a href="#Note_57">57</a>] and
Launay, the Company's servants Matel, Le
Conte Dompierre, Boissemont and Renault de St. Germain, the private
inhabitant Renault de la Fuye, and the two supercargoes of Indiamen
Delabar and Chambon. Caillot (or Caillaud) was wounded. The
official report of the loss of Chandernagore was drawn up on the
29th of March, 1757. The original is in the French Archives, and
Caillaud's signature shows that he was still suffering from his
wound. Sinfray we shall come across again. He joined Law at
Cossimbazar and accompanied him on his first retreat to Patna. Sent
back by Law, he joined Siraj-ud-daula, and commanded the small
French contingent at Plassey. When the battle was lost he took
refuge in Birbhum, was arrested by the Raja, and handed over to the
English.</p>
<p>The immediate gain to the English by the capture of Chandernagore
was immense. Clive wrote to the Select Committee at Madras:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I
cannot at present give you an account to what value</span><br

merchandize remaining, having sold off most of their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Imports
and even their investment for Europe to pay in part</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

for the expeditious re-establishment of Calcutta</span><br

it is an inexpressible blow to the French Company."<a name="59"></a>[<a

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The French gentlemen, after having signed under protest the document
presented to them by Clive, betook themselves to Chinsurah, where
they repudiated their signatures as having been extorted by force,
subsequent to, and contrary to, the capitulation. They proceeded to
communicate with Pondicherry, their up-country Factories, and the
native Government; they also gave assistance to French soldiers who
had escaped from Chandernagore. Clive and the Calcutta Council were
equally determined to interpret the capitulation in their own way,
and sent Renault an order, through M. Bisdom, the Dutch Director, to
repair to the British camp. Renault refused, and when Clive sent a
party of sepoys for him and the other councillors, they appealed to
M. Bisdom for the protection of the Dutch flag. M. Bisdom informed
them somewhat curtly that they had come to him without his
invitation, that he had no intention of taking any part in their
quarrels, that he would not give them the protection of his flag to
enable them to intrigue against the English, and, in short,
requested them to leave Dutch territory. As it was evident that the
British were prepared to use force, Renault and the Council gave in,
and were taken to Calcutta, where, for some time, they were kept
close prisoners. It was not till the Nawab had been overthrown at
Plassey, that they were absolutely released, and even then it was
only that they might prepare for their departure from Bengal.
Renault surmises, quite correctly, that this severity was probably
due to the fear that they would assist the Nawab.</p>
<p>The following incident during Renault's captivity shows how little
could be expected from the Nawab towards a friend who was no longer
able to be of use to him. After the capture of Chandernagore the
English Council called on the Nawab to surrender the French
up-country Factories to them. Siraj-ud-daula had not even yet
learned the folly of his double policy. On the 4th of April he wrote
to Clive:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>

<p>The more we study the records of the time, the more clearly we
realize the terrible determination of Clive's character, and we
almost feel a kind of pity for the weak creatures who found
themselves opposed to him, until we come across incidents like the
above, which show the depths of meanness to which they were prepared
to descend.</p>
<p>As to Renault's further career little is known, and that little we
should be glad to forget. Placed in charge of the French Settlement
at Karical, he surrendered, on the 5th of April, 1760, to what was
undoubtedly an overwhelming British force, but after so poor a
defence that he was brought before a Court Martial and cashiered. It
speaks highly for the respect in which he had been held by both
nations that none of the various reports and accounts of the siege
mention him by name. Even Lally, who hated the French Civilians,
though he says he deserved death,<a name="64"></a>[<a href="#Note_64">64</a>]
only refers to him indirectly
as being the same officer of the Company who had surrendered
Chandernagore to Clive.</p>
<p>We shall now pass to what went on in Siraj-ud-daula's Court and
capital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>M. LAW, CHIEF OF COSSIMBAZAR</h2>
<br>
<p>A few miles out of Murshidabad, capital of the Nawabs of Bengal
since 1704, when Murshid Kuli Khan transferred his residence from
Dacca to the ancient town of Muxadabad and renamed it after himself,
lay a group of European Factories in the village or suburb of
Cossimbazar.[<a name="65"></a><a href="#Note_65">65</a>] Of these, one
only, the English, was fortified; the
others, i.e. the French and Dutch, were merely large houses lying in
enclosures, the walls of which might keep out cattle and wild
animals and even thieves, but were useless as fortifications. In
1756 the Chief of the English Factory, as we have already seen, was
the Worshipful Mr. William Watts; the Dutch factory was under M.
Vernet,[<a name="66"></a><a href="#Note_66" style="font-style: italic;">66</a>]
and the French under M. Jean Law. The last mentioned was
the elder son of William Law, brother of John</p>
<p><a name="MUXADABAD_OR_MURSHIDABAD"></a><img src="images/tfb004.jpg"
 title="MUXADABAD, OR MURSHIDABAD. (After Rennell.)"
 alt="MUXADABAD, OR MURSHIDABAD. (After Rennell.)"
 style="width: 897px; height: 1700px;"></p>
<p>Law the financier, who settled in France, and placed his sons in
the French service. French writers[<a name="67"></a><a href="#Note_67">67</a>]
on genealogy have hopelessly
mixed up the two brothers, Jean and Jacques Fran&ccedil;ois. Both came
to
India, both distinguished themselves, both rose to the rank of
colonel, one by his services to the French East India Company, and
one by the usual promotion of an officer in the King's army. The
only proof that the elder was the Chief of Cossimbazar is to be
found in a few letters, mostly copies, in which his name is given as
Jean or John. As a usual rule he signed himself in the French manner
by his surname only, or as Law of Lauriston.</p>
<p>His experiences during the four years following the accession of
Siraj-ud-daula were painful and exciting, and he has recorded them
in a journal or memoir[<a name="68"></a><a href="#Note_68">68</a>]
which has never yet been published, but
which is of great interest to the student of Indian history. For us
it has the added charm of containing a picture of ourselves painted
by one who, though a foreigner by education, was enabled by his
birth to understand our national peculiarities. In the present
chapter I shall limit myself almost entirely to quotations from this
memoir.</p>
<p>Law was by no means an admirer of Aliverdi Khan's successor,&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>So bad was the reputation of this young prince, that many persons,
among them Mr. Watts, imagined it impossible that the people would
ever tolerate his accession. The European nations in Bengal had no
regular representatives at the Court of the Nawab; and the Chiefs of
the Factories at Cossimbazar, though now and then admitted to the
<i>Durbar</i>, transacted their business mainly through <i>wakils</i>,
or
native agents, who, of course, had the advantage of knowing the
language and, what was of much greater importance, understood all
those indirect ways in which in Eastern countries one's own business
is forwarded and that of one's rivals thwarted. Then, as now, the
difficulty of dealing with native agents was to induce these agents
to express their own opinions frankly and clearly.[<a name="70"></a><a
 href="#Note_70">70</a>] So far from
the English Chief being corrected by his <i>wakil</i>, we find the
latter, whilst applying to other nobles for patronage and
assistance, studiously refraining from making any application to
Siraj-ud-daula when English business had to be transacted at Court.</p>
<p>The English went even further:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"On
certain occasions they refused him admission into</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">their
factory at Cossimbazar and their country houses,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">because,
in fact, this excessively blustering and impertinent</span><br

  <span

man used to break the furniture, or, if it pleased his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fancy,
take it away. But Siraj-ud-daula was not the man</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
forget what he regarded as an insult. The day after the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">capture
of the English fort at Cossimbazar, he was heard to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">say
in full <i>Durbar</i>, 'Behold the English, formerly so proud</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
they did not wish to receive me in their houses!' In</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">short,
people knew, long before the death of Aliverdi Khan,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
Siraj-ud-daula was hostile to the English."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>With the French it was different:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

It being our interest to humour him, we had received</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">friendship
for us. The previous year (1755) had been a</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
influence that I was enabled to conclude this affair, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Aliverdi
Khan allowed him to retain all the profit from it,</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">so
I can say that I had no bad place in the heart of Siraj-ud-daula.</span><br

  <span

to be feared, who could be useful to us, <i>and who might</i></span><i

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">been
at least as vicious as Siraj-ud-daula, and yet he had</span><br

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law, therefore, had cultivated the young Nawab. Mr. Watts, on the
other hand, was not only foolish enough to neglect him, but carried
his folly to extremes. He was not in a position to prevent his
accession, and ought therefore to have been careful by the
correctness of his behaviour to show no signs of being opposed to
it. So far from this, he is strongly suspected of having entered
into correspondence with the widow of Nawajis Khan, who had adopted
Siraj-ud-daula's younger brother[<a name="72"></a><a href="#Note_72">72</a>]
and was supporting his
candidature for the throne, and also with Saukat Jang, Nawab of
Purneah and cousin of Siraj-ud-daula, who was trying to obtain the
throne for himself. Still further, he advised Mr. Drake, Governor of
Calcutta, to give shelter to Kissendas, son of Raj Balav (Nawajis
Khan's <i>Diwan</i>), who had fled with the treasures in his charge
when
his father was called to account for his master's property.</p>
<p>Contrary to Mr. Watts's expectations, Aliverdi Khan's last acts so
smoothed the way for Siraj-ud-daula, and the latter acted with such
decision and promptitude on his grandfather's death, that in an
incredibly short time he had all his enemies at his feet, and was at
leisure to attend to state business, and especially the affairs of
the foreign Settlements. Aliverdi Khan had always been extremely
jealous of allowing the European nations to erect any
fortifications, but, during his last illness, all of them, expecting
a contested succession, during which, owing to complications in
Europe, they might find themselves at war with each other in India,
began to repair their old walls or to erect new ones. This was
exactly what Siraj-ud-daula wanted. His first care on his accession
had been to make himself master of his grandfather's and uncle's
treasures. To these he had added those of such of his grandfather's
servants as he could readily lay hands on. Other wealthy nobles and
officers had fled to the English, or were suspected of having
secretly sent their treasures to Calcutta. It was also supposed that
the European Settlements, and especially Calcutta, were filled with
the riches accumulated by the foreigners. Whilst, therefore, the
Nawab was determined to make all the European nations contribute
largely in honour of his accession, and in atonement for their
insolence in fortifying themselves without his permission, he had
special reasons for beginning with the English. In the mean time,
however, he had first to settle with his cousin, Saukat Jang, the
Nawab of Purneah, so he contented himself with sending orders to the
Chiefs of the Factories to pull down their new fortifications. Law
acted wisely and promptly.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The English behaved very differently, and their answer, which was
bold if not insolent in tone,[<a name="73"></a><a href="#Note_73">73</a>]
reached the Nawab at the very
moment when he had received the submission of the Nawab of Purneah.
Law adds:&#8212;</p>

the answer from the English, than he jumped up in</span><br

<p></p>
<p>Cossimbazar surrendered without firing a shot, owing to the
treacherous advice of the Nawab's generals, and Siraj-ud-daula
advanced on Calcutta. It was with the greatest difficulty that Law
escaped being forced to march in his train.</p>

I thought to myself this was so much time gained."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>The Nawab captured Calcutta without any open assistance from the
French, and, though he set free most of the prisoners who survived
the Black Hole, he sent Holwell and three others before him to
Murshidabad. Law, who had already sheltered Mrs. Watts and her
family, and such of the English of Cossimbazar as had been able to
escape to him, now showed similar kindness to Holwell and his
companions. Of this he says modestly:&#8212;</p>

have liked to do."[<a name="77"></a><a href="#Note_77">77</a>]</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>He also, apparently with some difficulty, obtained consent to M.
Courtin's request for the release of the English prisoners at Dacca;
for&#8212;</p>

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">tempted
to adorn his harem with them."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law's success in these matters is a striking instance of his
personal influence, for Siraj-ud-daula was by no means any longer
well disposed towards the French and Dutch.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
fear of drawing on his back all the European</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">treat
us with the greatest kindness. He said the same to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Dutch, but when Calcutta was taken the mask fell. He</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
nothing more to fear. Scarcely had he arrived at Hugli</span><br

summon the commandants to pay contributions, or to</span><br

In short, we were forced to yield what the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab
demanded; whilst he, as he said, was content with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">having
punished a nation which had offended him, and with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

put the others to ransom to pay for the expenses of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

little thinking of the punishment which Providence</span><br

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
preparing for his crimes, and to make which still</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">more
striking, he was yet to have some further successes."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It may be here pointed out that, not only did the Nawab not insist
on the destruction of the French and Dutch fortifications, but he
did not destroy the fortifications of Calcutta. This proves that if
the English had shown the humility and readiness to contribute which
he desired, he would have left them in peace at the first, or, after
the capture of Calcutta, have permitted them to resettle there
without farther disturbance. In short, the real necessity of making
the European nations respect his authority, instead of guiding him
in a settled course, merely provided a pretext for satisfying his
greed. This is the opinion, not only of the French and English who
were at Murshidabad when the troubles began, but of the English
officials who went there later on and made careful inquiries amongst
all classes of people in order to ascertain the real reason of
Siraj-ud-daula's attack upon the English.</p>
<p>His avarice was to prove the Nawab's ruin.</p>

<blockquote><span

was one of the richest Nawabs that had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ever
reigned. Without mentioning his revenues, of which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
gave no account at the Court of Delhi, he possessed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">immense
wealth, both in gold and silver coin, and in jewels</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
precious stones, which had been left by the preceding</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">three
Nawabs. In spite of this he thought only of increasing</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
wealth. If any extraordinary expense had to be met</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
ordered contributions, and levied them with extreme</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">rigour.
Having never known himself what it was to want</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">money,
he supposed that, in due proportion, money was as</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">common
with other people as with himself, and that the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Europeans
especially were inexhaustible. His violence</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">towards
them was partly due to this. In fact, from his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">behaviour,
one would have said his object was to ruin everybody.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">He
spared no one, not even his relatives, from whom</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
took all the pensions and all the offices which they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
held in the time of Aliverdi Khan. Was it possible for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">such
a man to keep his throne? Those who did not know</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him
intimately, when they saw him victorious over his</span><br

some great virtue which balanced his vices and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">counteracted
their effects. However, this young giddy-pate</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
no talent for government except that of making himself</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">feared,
and, at the same time, passed for the most cowardly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
men. At first he had shown some regard for the officers of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
army, because, until he was recognized as Nawab, he felt</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
need of them. He had even shown generosity, but this</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">quality,
which was quite opposed to his real character,<br>
&nbsp;soon disappeared,</span><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
make place for violence and greed, which decided</span><br

  <span

him all those who had favoured his accession in the</span><br

that he would behave discreetly when he became Nawab."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>Owing to the general disgust felt at Murshidabad for the Nawab, his
cousin, Saukat Jang, Nawab of Purneah, thought the opportunity
favourable for reviving his claims, and, early in October,
Siraj-ud-daula, hearing of his contemplated rebellion, invaded his
country.</p>

<p>Every one in the land turned wistful eyes towards the English, but
they lay inactive at Fulta, and it seemed as if help from Madras
would never come. The English, therefore, tried to bring about a
revolution favourable to themselves at Murshidabad, and began to
look for persons who might be induced to undertake it; but this was
not easy, as the Moor nobles had little acquaintance with the
Europeans. Of the Hindus in Bengal&#8212;</p>

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

wealth, and some day or other it was certain he would</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">seize
it. These bankers, then, were the persons to serve the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">English.
They could by themselves have formed a party,</span><br

even without the assistance of any Europeans, have</span><br

race which does not like to risk danger. To stimulate</span><br

<p></p>
<p>Just as it seemed likely that the English would have to stoop to the
Nawab's terms, they received news of the despatch of reinforcements
from Madras. About the same time, it became known to both French and
English that France and England had declared war against each other
in the preceding May.[<a name="81"></a><a href="#Note_81">81</a>] The
English naturally said nothing about
it, and the French were too eager to see the Nawab well beaten to
put any unnecessary obstacles in their way. The negotiations with
the friends of the Europeans at Murshidabad were quietly continued
until Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive arrived. A rapid advance was
then made on Calcutta, which was captured with hardly any
resistance.</p>
<p>Siraj-ud-daula was so little disturbed by the recapture of Calcutta
that the French thought everything would terminate amicably, but,
possibly owing to the reputation of Watson and Clive, who had so
long fought against the French,[<a name="82"></a><a href="#Note_82">82</a>]
they thought it likely that, if
the English demanded compensation for their losses, the Nawab would
allow them to recoup themselves by seizing the French Settlements.
M. Renault, therefore, wrote to Law to make sure that, in any treaty
between the Nawab and the English, an article should be inserted
providing for the neutrality of the Ganges; but the French, at
present, were needlessly alarmed. The English had no intention of
creeping quietly back into the country. Watson and Clive addressed
haughty letters to the Nawab, demanding reparation for the wrongs
inflicted on the English; and the Admiral and the Council declared
war in the name of the King and the Company. This possibly amused
the Nawab, who took no notice of their letters; but it was a
different matter when a small English force sailed up the Hugli,
passed Chandernagore unopposed by the French, captured the fort of
Hugli, burnt Hugli[<a name="83"></a><a href="#Note_83">83</a>] and
Bandel towns, and ravaged both banks of
the river down to Calcutta. The French were in an awkward position.
The English had passed Chandernagore without a salute, which was an
unfriendly, if not a hostile act; whilst the Nawab thought that, as
the French had not fired on them, they must be in alliance with
them. Law had to bear the brunt of this suspicion. His common sense
told him that the English would never consent to a neutrality, and
he wrote to Renault that it was absolutely necessary to join the
Moors.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
neutrality was by no means obligatory, as no treaty</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">existed.
In fact, what confidence could we have in a forced</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">neutrality,
which had been observed so long only out of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fear
of the Nawab, who for the general good of the country</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
unwilling to allow any act of hostility to be committed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">by
the Europeans? Much more so when the English were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">at
war with the Nawab himself. If they managed to get</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
better of him, what would become of this fear, the sole</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">foundation
of the neutrality?"</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>So Law wrote to Renault, begging him, if he could not persuade the
English to sign a treaty of neutrality at once, to make up his mind
and join the Nawab. We have seen why Renault could do neither, and
Law, writing after the event says, generously enough:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I
am bound to respect the reasons which determined</span><br

Renault as well as the gentlemen of the Council, who</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">were
all much too good citizens not to have kept constantly</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">not
always prove the correctness or incorrectness of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">reasons
which have decided us to take one or the other course."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as the Nawab heard of the plundering of Hugli he set out for
Calcutta, but to blind the English he requested M. Renault to
mediate between them. The English refusal to treat through the
French had the effect of clearing up matters between the latter and
the Nawab; but he could not understand why the French would not
actively assist him. Certain, at any rate, that he had only the
English to deal with, he foolishly played into their hands by
marching to fight them on their own ground, whereas, if he had
remained idle at a little distance, merely forbidding supplies to be
sent them, he could have starved them out of Calcutta in a few
months. As I have said before, Clive attacked his camp on the 5th of
February, and so terrified him that he consented to a shameful
peace, in which he forgot all mention of the neutrality of the
Ganges. Law tells a curious story to the effect that what frightened
the Nawab most of all was a letter from Admiral Watson, threatening
to make him a prisoner and carry him to England. Watson's letter is
extant, and contains no such threat, but it is quite possible that
it was so interpreted to the Nawab.</p>
<p>Though the Nawab had assured the English that he would have the same
friends and enemies as they, and had omitted to mention the French
in the treaty, he now, of his own accord, gave the French all that
the English had extorted from him. This act could not be kept
secret.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

of the letters written on both sides."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>Yet Law thinks it was only the European war and the fear that
Renault intended an alliance with the Nawab that induced the English
to proceed to extremities:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

not show them the same respect as the old Nawab</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Aliverdi
Khan had done; but the arrival of the English</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">forces,
the capture of the Moorish forts, and the fright of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab before Calcutta, had made a change which was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">apparently
in their favour. The Nawab began to perceive</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
the bankers were necessary to him. The English</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">would
have no one except them as mediators, and so they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
become, as it were, responsible for the behaviour of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">both
the Nawab and the English. Accordingly after the</span><br

there was nothing but kindness and politeness from</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab towards them, and he consulted them in everything.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">At
the bottom this behaviour of his was sheer</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">trickery.
The Seths were persuaded that the Nawab who</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">hated
the English must also dislike the persons whom the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">English
employed. Profiting by the hatred which the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab
had drawn on himself by his violence, and distributing</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">money
judiciously, they had long since gained over</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">those
who were nearest to the Nawab, whose imprudence</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">always
enabled them to know what he had in his heart.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">From
what came to the knowledge of the Seths it was easy</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
guess what he intended, and this made them tremble, for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it
was nothing less than their destruction, which could be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">averted
only by his own. The cause of the English had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">become
that of the Seths; their interests were identical. Can</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">one
be surprised to see them acting in concert? Further,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">when
one remembers that it was this same house of bankers</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
overthrew Sarfaraz Khan[<a name="85"></a><a href="#Note_85">85</a>] to
enthrone Aliverdi Khan,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

who, during the reign of the latter, had the management</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
all important business, one must confess that it ought not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
be difficult for persons of so much influence to execute a</span><br

<p></p>
<p>Law could not persuade Renault to act, and without his doing so the
game was nearly hopeless. Still, he worked at forming a French party
in the Court. By means of Coja Wajid, an Armenian merchant of
Hugli, whose property had been plundered by the English, he obtained
an interview with the Nawab, and persuaded him to send the 2000
soldiers who were with Renault at the beginning of the siege. More
would have been despatched but for the apparent certainty that the
treaty of neutrality would be signed. In fact, Renault was so
worried that, on the complaint of Watson and Clive that Law was
exciting the Nawab against the English, he wrote Law a letter which
caused the latter to ask to be recalled from Cossimbazar, and it was
only at Renault's earnest request that he consented to remain at his
post. Law continued forming his party.</p>

interests.</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

mention the Nawab first. His hatred for the English</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">certainly
indicated friendship for us. I think so myself, but</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">we
have seen what was his character and his state of mind</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
general. I ask, in all good faith, whether we could expect</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">any
advantage from his friendship? This person, cowed by</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fear,
irresolute and imprudent, could he alone be of any use</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
us? It was necessary for him to be supported by some</span><br

  <span

who had his confidence and was capable by his own</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

the greatest scoundrel the earth has ever borne, worthy</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">minister
of such a master, and yet, in truth, the only person</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">who
was really attached to him. He had firmness and also</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">sufficient
judgment to understand that the ruin of Siraj-ud-daula</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">must
necessarily bring on his own. He was as much,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">detested
as his master. The sworn enemy of the Seths, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">capable
of holding his own against them, I think those</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bankers
would not have succeeded so easily in their project</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

he had been free to act, but, unfortunately for us, he had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">been
for some time, and was at this most critical moment</span><br

ill. He could not leave his house. I went to</span><br

him twice with Siraj-ud-daula, but it was not possible to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">get
a word from him. There is strong reason to believe he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
been poisoned. Owing to this, Siraj-ud-daula saw himself</span><br

because, as he had frequented the Europeans and especially</span><br

man to whom I was bound to trust most. Before the</span><br

English. It was he who pretended to have beaten them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to have taken Calcutta. He wished, he said, to maintain</span><br

reputation; but after the affair of the 5th of February,</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
which the only part he took was to share in the flight, he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
not the same man; he feared nothing so much as to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">have
to fight the English. This fear disposed him to gradually</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">come
to terms with the Seths, of whose greatness he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

very jealous. He also hated the Nawab, by whom he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
been ill-used on many occasions. In short, I could never</span><br

him to say a single word in our favour in the <i>Durbar</i>.</span><br

for the present, though firmly resolved to join finally</span><br

side which appeared to him to be the strongest."</span><br>

<p>With such enemies to combat in the Court itself, Law heard that the

to whom I promised rewards proportionate to their</span><br

On the one hand, they assured him that the march</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of

treaty of neutrality, and on the other hand they increased</span><br

  <span

natural timidity by exaggerating the force of the English</span><br

by representing the risk he ran in assisting us with</span><br

the want of punctuality in our payments. I said that</span><br

they supported the English against us. They denied it,</span><br

after much explanation, they promised to make any</span><br

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">suggestions
I wished to the Nawab. They added that they</span><br

quite sure the English would not attack us, and that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
might remain tranquil. Knowing that they were well</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">acquainted
with the designs of the English, I told them I</span><br

way of preventing them from attacking Chandernagore</span><br

by hastening the despatch of the reinforcements which</span><br

me, I begged them to make the Nawab understand the</span><br

with the English, and they said many other things</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
only showed me that, in spite of their good will, they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">would
do nothing for us. Ranjit Rai, who was their man</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
business as well as the agent of the English, said to me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
a mocking tone, 'You are a Frenchman; are you afraid of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
English? If they attack you, defend yourselves! No</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">this
business here.' I told him I did not expect to find such</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a
warlike person in a Bengali merchant, and that sometimes</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">people
repented of their curiosity. That was enough for such</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a
fellow, but I saw clearly that the laugh would not be on</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
side. However, every one was very polite, and I left</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
house."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law thinks the Seths honestly believed that the English march on
Chandernagore was merely intended to frighten the French, and, as a
proof of their friendliness, narrates a further incident of this
visit:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
conversation having turned on Siraj-ud-daula, on</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
reasons he had given the Seths to fear him, and on his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">violent
character, I said I understood clearly enough what</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">they
meant, and that they certainly wanted to set up another</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab.
The Seths, instead of denying this, contented themselves</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
saying in a low voice that this was a subject</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
should not be talked about. Omichand, the English</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">agent[<a

with them!' wherever</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
went), was present. If the fact had been false, the Seths</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">would
certainly have denied it, and would have reproached</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
for talking in such a way. If they had even thought</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
intended to thwart them, they would also have denied</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it,
but considering all that had happened, the vexations</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">caused
us by the Nawab and our obstinate refusals to help</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him,
they imagined that we should be just as content as they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">were
to see him deposed, provided only the English would</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">leave
us in peace. In fact, they did not as yet regard us as</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">enemies."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law was, however, ignorant that Clive had already promised, or did
so soon after, to give the property of the French Company to the
Seths in payment of the money the French owed them; but he now for
the first time fully realized the gravity of the situation. The
indiscretion of the Seths showed him the whole extent of the plot,
and the same evening he told the Nawab, but&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"the
poor young man began to laugh, not being able to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">imagine
I could be so foolish as to indulge in such ideas."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>And yet, whilst he refused to believe in the treason of his
officers, the Nawab indulged at times in the most violent outbreaks
of temper against them.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Siraj-ud-daula

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">have
needed as much firmness in his character as there was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">deceitfulness
to make the latter quality of use to him. At</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">certain
times his natural disposition overmastered him,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">especially
when in his harem surrounded by his wives and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">servants,
when he was accustomed to say openly all that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
in his heart. Sometimes this happened to him in full</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><i>Durbar</i>."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The same evening, also, Mr. Watts came to the <i>Durbar</i>, and
the
matter of the neutrality was talked over. The Nawab wished the two
gentlemen to pledge their respective nations to keep the peace, but
Mr. Watts skilfully avoided giving any promise, and suggested the
Nawab should write to the Admiral. Law, seeing that further delay
was aimed at, exclaimed that the Admiral would pay as little respect
to this letter as to the Nawab's previous ones.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"'How?'
said the Nawab, looking angrily at me instead</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
at Mr. Watts: 'who am I then?' All the members of his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Court
cried out together that his orders would certainly be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">attended
to."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As Law expected, Chandernagore was attacked before the Admiral's
reply was received. Law received the news on the 15th, and hurried
to the Nawab. Reinforcements were ordered and counter-ordered. At
midnight the Nawab's eunuch came to inform Law that the English had
been repulsed with loss, and on the morning of the 16th the Nawab's
troops were ordered to advance, but when the same day news came that
the French had withdrawn into the Fort, every one cried out that the
Fort must fall, and that it was mere folly to incense the English by
sending down troops. They were immediately recalled. Then news
arrived that the Fort was holding out, and Rai Durlabh Ram was
ordered to advance. Again there came a false report that the Fort
had fallen. Law knew Rai Durlabh was a coward, and his whole
reliance was on the second in command, Mir Madan:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"a
capable officer, and one who would have attacked the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">enemy
with pleasure."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This Mir Madan is said to have been a Hindu convert to
Muhammadanism. Native poems still tell of the gallantry with which
he commanded the Hindu soldiers of the Nawab. He was one of the
first to fall at Plassey, and though it cannot be said that his
death caused the loss of the battle, it is certain that it put an
end to all chance of the victory being contested.</p>
<p>Law was at his wits' end. It was no time to stick at trifles, and,
that he might know the worst at once, he intercepted Mr. Watts's
letters. From them he gathered that the English intended to march
straight upon Murshidabad. He set about fortifying the enclosure
round the French Factory, and, as he had only 10 or 12 men, he
induced the Nawab to send him a native officer with 100 musketeers.
He soon learned that the reported English advance was merely the
pursuit of the fugitives from Chandernagore, who were mentioned in
the last chapter. By the end of March he had 60 Europeans:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"of
whom the half, in truth, were not fit to serve; but what</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">did
that matter? The number was worth 120 to me outside</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
fort, since rumour always delights in exaggeration."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Of the sepoys also, whom the English set free, some 30 found their
way to Law, and so far was he now from being afraid of Mr. Watts,
that it was the latter who had to ask the Nawab's protection.</p>
<p>The vacillation which had marked the Nawab's conduct previous to the
fall of Chandernagore still continued. He protected Law, but would
not help him with money.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

at the solicitation of my enemies, the Nawab</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

people to pull down the earthworks I had erected. He</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">even
wished the native agent of the English to be present.</span><br

  <span

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Factory no foreigner should touch my fortifications, but</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
to keep my agreement with him I was ready to withdraw</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to make over the Factory to him, with which he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">could
afterwards do as he liked, and for which I should hold</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him
responsible. At the same time, I made my whole troop</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">arm
themselves, and, having had my munitions loaded on</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">carts
for several days previous, I prepared to depart with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
small amount of money which belonged to me and to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a
few other individuals. The Nawab's officer, seeing my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">resolution,
and fearing to do anything which, might not be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">approved,
postponed the execution of his orders, and informed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab of what was happening. He replied that he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">absolutely
forbade my leaving the Factory, and ordered the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">pioneers
to be sent away; but at the same time he informed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
that it was absolutely necessary for me to pull down the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">earthworks,
that under the present circumstances he had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">himself
to do many things contrary to his own wishes, that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">by
refusing to obey I should draw the English upon him</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
upon us, that we could not defend ourselves and must</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

submit, that I should not be troubled any more,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
that, finally, he would give me money enough to build</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
brick what I had wished to make in earth. I knew well</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
value of his promises, but I was forced to humour him.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">It
did not suit me to abandon the Factory altogether, so I set</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

workmen to pull down what I had built, and the same</span><br

the work was finished."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>The English now tried to win over the French soldiers, and had some
success, for many of them were deserters from the British forces,
and they quickly saw how precarious was the shelter which Law could
afford them; but the Nawab could not be persuaded to force Law to
surrender, and, though he agreed to leave the country, Law declared
he would not do even that unless he received passports and money. On
the 8th of April he received passports, and was promised that if he
would go to Phulbari, near Patna, he should there receive all he
wanted. He was allowed four or five days to make his preparations.</p>

  <span

many things of particular interest to the Nawab, and I</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

received quite as much from the English as from us. He</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

the Nawab all that he learned from me, <i>viz.</i> the views</span><br

  <span

the English and of the Seths, and the risk he himself was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">running,
and he brought to his notice that the English were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">steadily
increasing their garrison at Cossimbazar by bringing</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">pass
over to the Trench. By this trick, indeed, many soldiers</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
passed through the Moorish camp without being stopped.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

  <span

waiting only for the Nawab's permission. The Nazir</span><br

represented to him that the trading boats might be</span><br

and the casks and barrels opened, as guns and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">mortars
might be found in them. The Nawab opened his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">eyes
at information of this kind, and promptly sent the Nazir</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Dalal
to tell me not to leave. This order came on the 10th</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
April. I accordingly passed my garrison in review before</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab's agent, and a statement showing the monthly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">pay
of each officer and soldier was sent to the Nawab, who</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">promised
to pay them accordingly."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>On the 12th of April Law received a sudden summons to attend the
<i>Durbar</i> the next day.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"After
some reflection, I determined to obey. I thought</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
by taking presents I could avoid the inconveniences I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">feared,
so I arranged to start early on the morning of the 13th</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
five or six persons well armed. A slight rain detained</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">us
till 10 o'clock. On leaving I told my people that M.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Sinfray
was their commandant, and ordered him, if I did not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">return
by 2 o'clock, to send a detachment of forty men to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">meet
me. We arrived at the Nawab's palace about midday.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">He
had retired to his harem. We were taken into the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Audience
Hall, where they brought us a very bad dinner.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">The
Nawab, they said, would soon come. However, 5 o'clock</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
struck and he had not yet dressed. During this wearisome</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">interval
I was visited by some of the <i>Diwans</i>, among</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">others
by the <i>Arzbegi.</i>[<a name="94"></a><a href="#Note_94">94</a>] I
asked him why the Nawab had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">called
me. He replied with an appearance of sincerity that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">as
the Nawab was constantly receiving complaints from the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">English,
about the numerous garrison we had in our Factory,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
had judged it proper to summon both Mr. Watts and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">myself
in order to reconcile us, and that he hoped to arrange</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">matters
so that the English should have nothing to fear from</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">us
nor we from them. He added that the Nawab was quite</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">satisfied
with my behaviour, and wished me much good. At</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">last
the <i>Durbar</i> hour arrives. I am warned. I pass into a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">hall,
where I find Mr. Watts and a number of <i>Diwans</i>. The</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">agent
of the Seths is present Compliments having passed,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">one
of the <i>Diwans</i> asks me if I have anything particular to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">say
to Mr. Watts. I answer that I have not. Thereupon</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Mr.
Watts addresses me in English: 'The question is, sir,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whether
you are prepared to surrender your Factory to me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to go down to Calcutta with all your people. You will</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">be
well treated, and will be granted the same conditions as</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
gentlemen of Chandernagore. This is the Nawab's wish.'</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
reply I will do nothing of the kind, that I and all those</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
me are free, that if I am forced to leave Cossimbazar</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
will surrender the Factory to the Nawab, and to no one else.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Mr.
Watts, turning round to the <i>Diwans</i>, says excitedly, that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it
is impossible to do anything with me, and repeats to them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">word
for word all that has passed between us.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"From
that moment I saw clearly that the air of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Court
was not healthy for us. It was, however, necessary to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">put
a good face on matters. The <i>Arzbegi</i> and some others,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">taking
me aside, begged me to consider what I was doing in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">refusing
Mr. Watts's propositions, and said that as the Nawab</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
determined to have a good understanding with the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">English,
he would force me to accept them. They then</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">asked
what I intended to do. I said I intended to stay at</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Cossimbazar
and to oppose, to the utmost of my power, the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ambitious
designs of the English. 'Well, well, what can</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">you
do?' they replied. 'You are about a hundred Europeans;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab has no need of you; you will certainly be forced</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
leave this place. It would be much better to accept the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">terms
offered you by Mr. Watts.' The same persons who had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">begged
me to do this then took Mr. Watts aside. I do not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">know
what they said to each other, but a quarter of an hour</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">after
they went into the hall where the Nawab was.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I
was in the utmost impatience to know the result of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">all
these parleyings, so much the more as from some words</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
had escaped them I had reason to think they intended</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
arrest me.</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Fire
or six minutes after Mr. Watts had gone to the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab,
the <i>Arzbegi</i>, accompanied by some officers and the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">agents
of the Seths and the English, came and told me aloud,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
the presence of some fifty persons of rank, that the Nawab</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ordered
me to submit myself entirely to what Mr. Watts</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">demanded.
I told him I would not, and that it was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">impossible
for the Nawab to have given such an order.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
demanded to be presented to him. 'The Nawab,' they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">said,
'does not wish to see you.' I replied, 'It was he who</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">summoned
me; I will not go away till I have seen him.'</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">The
  <i>Arzbegi</i> saw I had no intention of giving way, and that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
was well supported, for at this very moment word was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">brought
of the arrival of our grenadiers, who had been</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ordered
to come and meet me. Disappointed at not seeing</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
appear, they had advanced to the very gates of the palace.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">The
  <i>Arzbegi</i>, not knowing what would be the result of this</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">affair,
and wishing to get out of the scrape and to throw the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">burden
of it on to the Seths' agent, said to him, 'Do you</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">speak,
then; this affair concerns you more than us.' The</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Seths'
agent wished to speak, but I did not give him time.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
said I would not listen to him, that I did not recognize</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him
as having any authority, and that I had no business</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">at
all with him. Thereupon the <i>Arzbegi</i> went back to the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab
and told him I would not listen to reason, and that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
demanded to speak to him. 'Well, let him come,' said</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab, 'but he must come alone.' At the same time</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
asked Mr. Watts to withdraw and wait for him in a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cabinet.
The order to appear being given me, I wish to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">go&#8212;another
difficulty! The officers with me do not wish to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">let
me go alone! A great debate between them and the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab's
officers! At last, giving way to my entreaties,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
on my assuring them that I have no fears, I persuade</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">them
to be quiet and to let me go.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I
presented myself before the Nawab, who returned my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">salute
in a kindly manner. As soon as I was seated, he told</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me,
in a shamefaced way, that I must either accept Mr.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Watts's
proposals, or must certainly leave his territories.</span><br

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">now suffer from the English. I do
not wish to put the whole country</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">in trouble for your sake. You are
not strong enough to defend</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">yourselves; you must give way. You
ought to remember that when I had</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">need of your assistance you always
refused it. You ought not to</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">expect assistance from me now</span></i><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"It
must be confessed that, after all our behaviour to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him,
I had not much to reply. I noticed, however, that the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab
kept his eyes cast down, and that it was, as it were,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">against
his will that he paid me this compliment. I told</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him
I should be dishonoured if I accepted Mr. Watts's proposals,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">but
that as he was absolutely determined to expel us</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">from
his country, I was ready to withdraw, and that as soon</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">as
I had the necessary passports I would go towards Patna.</span><br

  <span

cried out that I could not take that road, that the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab
would not consent to it. I asked what road they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">wished
me to take. They said I must go towards Midnapur</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">or
Cuttack. I answered that the English might at any</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">moment
march in that direction and fall upon me. They</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">replied

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Nawab,
meanwhile, kept his face bent down, listening</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">attentively,
but saying nothing. Wishing to force him to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">speak,
I asked if it was his intention to cause me to fall into</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
hands of my enemies? 'No, no,' replied the Nawab,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">'take
what road you please, and may God conduct you.' I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">stood
up and thanked him, received the betel,[<a name="95"></a><a
 href="#Note_95">95</a>] and went out."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Gholam Husain Khan says that the Nawab was much affected at parting
with Law, as he now believed in the truth of his warnings against
the English and the English party,&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"but

offending the English, he told him that at present it was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fit
that he should depart; but that if anything new should</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">happen
he would send for him again. '<i>Send for me again?</i>'</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">answered
Law. '<i>Rest assured, my Lord Nawab, that this is</i></span><i
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the last time we shall see each
other. Remember my words: we</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">shall never meet again. It is
nearly impossible</span></i><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Law hurried back to his Factory, and by the evening of the 15th of
April he was ready to depart. The same day the Nawab wrote to
Clive:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Mr.
Law I have put out of the city, and have wrote</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

to my Naib[<a name="96"></a><a href="#Note_96">96</a>] at Patna to turn
him and his attendants</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">out
of the bounds of his Subaship, and that he shall not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">suffer
them to stay in any place within it."[<a name="97"></a><a
 href="#Note_97">97</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of April the Nawab wrote to Abdulla Khan, the Afghan
general at Delhi, that he had supplied Law with Rs.10,000. Clive was
quickly informed of this.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th the French marched through Murshidabad
with colours flying and drums beating, prepared against any surprise
in the narrow streets of the city. Mr. Watts wrote to Clive:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"They
had 100 Europeans, 60 Tellingees, 30 <i>hackerys</i>"</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">(i.e.
bullock-waggons) "and 4 elephants with them."[<a name="98"></a><a
 href="#Note_98">98</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Close on their track followed two spies, sent by Mr. Watts to try
and seduce the French soldiers and sepoys. Law left a M. Bugros
behind in charge of the French Factory.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving Cossimbazar, Law was reinforced by a party of
45 men, mostly sailors of the <i>Saint Contest</i>, who had managed to
escape from the English. On the 2nd of May the French arrived at
Bhagulpur, the Nawab writing to them to move on whenever he heard
they were halting, and not to go so fast when he heard they were on
the march.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"To
satisfy him we should have been always in motion</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

yet not advancing; this did not suit us. It was of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">utmost
importance to arrive at some place where I could</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">find
means for the equipment of my troop. We were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">destitute
of everything."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>These contradictory orders, and even letters of recall, reached Law
on his march, but though he sent back M. Sinfray with letters to M.
Bugros and Coja Wajid&#8212;which the latter afterwards made over to
Clive&#8212;he continued his march to Patna, where he arrived on the 3rd
of June, and was well received by Raja Ramnarain, and where he was
within four or five days' march or sail from Sooty, the mouth of the
Murshidabad or Cossimbazar river, and therefore in a position to
join the Nawab whenever it might be necessary.</p>
<p>In the mean time fate had avenged Law on one of his lesser enemies.
This was that Ranjit Rai, who had insulted him during his interview
with the Seths. The latter had pursued their old policy of inciting
the English to make extravagant demands which they at the same time
urged the Nawab to refuse. To justify one such demand, the English
produced a letter in the handwriting of Ranjit Rai, purporting to be
written at the dictation of the Seths under instructions from the
Nawab. The latter denied the instructions, and the Seths promptly
asserted that the whole letter was a forgery of their agent's.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
notorious Ranjit Rai was driven in disgrace from</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

  <i>Durbar</i>, banished, and assassinated on the road. It was</span><br

seal unknown to them. I can hardly believe this.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">This
agent was attached to the English only because he knew</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Seths were devoted to them."</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This incident warned the Seths to be more cautious, but still the
plot against the Nawab was well known in the country. Renault, who
had been at this time a prisoner in Calcutta, says:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

indiscretion as this was, both by the Moors and the</span><br

which was felt towards him."[<a name="99"></a><a href="#Note_99">99</a>]</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>M. Sinfray had returned to Murshidabad, but could not obtain an
interview with the Nawab till the 8th of June, when he found him
still absolutely tranquil; and even on the 10th the Nawab wrote to
Law to have no fears on his account; but this letter did not reach
Law till the 19th.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I
complained of the delay in the strongest terms to</span><br

who received the packets from the Nawab, but it</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
quite useless. The Nawab was betrayed by those whom</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

thought most attached to him. The Faujdar of Rajmehal</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">used
to stop all his messengers and detain them as long as</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
thought fit."</span><br>

<p></p>
<p>This officer was a brother of Mir Jafar.[<a name="100"></a><a
 href="#Note_100">100</a>] The Seths and the
English had long found the chief difficulty in their way to be the
choice of a man of sufficient distinction to replace Siraj-ud-daula
on the throne. At this moment the Nawab himself gave them as a
leader Mir Jafar Ali Khan, who had married the sister of Aliverdi
Khan, and was therefore a relative of his. Mir Jafar was <i>Bukshi</i>,
or Paymaster and Generalissimo of the Army, and his influence had
greatly contributed to Siraj-ud-daula's peaceful accession. He was a
man of good reputation, and a brave and skilful soldier. It was such
a person as this that the Nawab, after a long course of petty
insults, saw fit to abuse in the vilest terms in full <i>Durbar</i>
and
to dismiss summarily from his post. He now listened to the
proposals of the Seths, and towards the end of April terms were
settled between him and the English.[<a name="101"></a><a
 href="#Note_101">101</a>] The actual conclusion of
the Treaty took place early in June, and on the 13th of that month
Mr. Watts and the other English gentlemen at Cossimbazar escaped
under the pretence of a hunting expedition and joined Clive in
safety. As soon as he heard of this, the Nawab knew that war was
inevitable, and it had come at a moment when he had disbanded half
his army unpaid, and the other half was grumbling for arrears. Not
only had he insulted Mir Jafar, but he had also managed to quarrel
with Rai Durlabh. Instead of trying to postpone the conflict until
he had crushed these two dangerous enemies, he begged them to be
reconciled to him, and put himself in their hands. Letter after
letter was sent to recall Law, but even the first, despatched on the
13th, did not reach Law till the 22nd, owing to the treachery of the
Faujdar of Rajmehal. Law's letter entreating the Nawab to await his
arrival certainly never reached him, and though Law had started at
the first rumour of danger, before getting the Nawab's letter, he
did not reach Rajmehal till the 1st of July. The Nawab had been
captured in the neighbourhood a few hours before the arrival of his
advance-guard. Gholam Husain Khan says that Law would have been in
time had the Nawab's last remittance been a bill of exchange and not
an order on the Treasury, for&#8212;</p>

disappointment:&#8212;</p>

<p></p>
<p>His wisest councillors urged him to surrender to Clive, but he
thought this advice treacherous, and determined to flee towards
Rajmehal. When nearly there he was recognized by a Fakir,[<a name="103"></a><a
 href="#Note_103">103</a>] whose
ears he had, some time before, ordered to be cut off. The Fakir
informed the Faujdar, who seized him and sent him to Murshidabad,
where Miran, Mir Jafar's son, put him to death on the 4th of July.</p>
<p>It was necessary for Law to withdraw as quickly as possible if he
was to preserve his liberty. Clive and Mir Jafar wrote urgent
letters to Ramnarain at Patna to stop him, but Ramnarain was no
lover of Mir Jafar, and he was not yet acquainted with Clive, so he
allowed him to pass. Law says:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

<p>Before Law left Rajmehal on his return to Patna, the Faujdar tried
to stop him on pretence that Mir Jafar wished to reconcile him to
the English. Law thought this unlikely, yet knowing the native
proclivity for underhand intrigue, he wrote him a letter, but the
answer which he received at Chupra was merely an order to
surrender. Law says:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span

up the idea of making himself Nawab. He appeared</span><br

<p>Law thought his communication&#8212;</p>

<p>Law does not say much about the hardships of his flight; but Eyre
Coote, who commanded the detachment which followed him, had the
utmost difficulty in persuading his men to advance, and wrote to
Clive that he had never known soldiers exposed to greater hardships.
At Patna Eyre Coote seized the French Factory, where the Chief, M.
de la Bretesche, was lying ill. The military and other Company's
servants had gone on with Law, leaving in charge a person variously
called M. Innocent and Innocent Jesus. He was not a Frenchman, but
nevertheless he was sent down to Calcutta. From Patna Eyre Coote got
as far as Chupra, only to find Law safe beyond the frontier at
Ghazipur, and nothing left for him to do but to return.</p>
<p>From now on to January, 1761, Law was out of the reach of the
English, living precariously on supplies sent from Bussy in the
south, from his wife at Chinsurah, and from a secret store which M.
de la Bretesche had established at Patna unknown to the English, and
upon loans raised from wealthy natives, such as the Raja of
Bettiah. He believed all along that the French would soon make an
effort to invade Bengal, where there was a large native party in
their favour, and where he could assist them by creating a diversion
in the north. I shall touch on his adventures very briefly.</p>
<p>His first halt was at Benares, which he reached on the 2nd of
August, and where the Raja Bulwant Singh tried to wheedle and
frighten him into surrendering his guns. He escaped out of his hands
by sheer bluff, and went on to Chunargarh, where he received letters
from Suja-ud-daula, Nawab of Oudh, a friend of Siraj-ud-daula's,
whom he hoped to persuade into invading Bengal. On the 3rd of
September he reached Allahabad, and here left his troop under the
command of M. le Comte de Carryon, whilst he went on to Lucknow, the
capital of Oudh.</p>
<p>It is only at this moment that Law bethinks him of describing his
troop. It consisted of 175 Europeans and 100 sepoys drilled in
European fashion. The officers were D'Hurvilliers, le Comte de
Carryon (who had brought a detachment from Dacca before Law left
Cossimbazar), Ensign Brayer (who had commanded the military at
Patna), Ensign Jobard (who had escaped from Chandernagore), and
Ensign Martin de la Case. He also entertained as officers MM.
Debell&ecirc;me (Captain of a French East Indiaman), Boissemont, and La
Ville Mart&egrave;re, Company's servants (these three had all escaped
from
Chandernagore), Dangereux and Dubois (Company's servants stationed
at Cossimbazar), Beinges (a Company's servant stationed at Patna),
and two private gentlemen, Kerdizien and Gourbin. Besides these, MM.
Anquetil du Perron,[<a name="105"></a><a href="#Note_105">105</a>] La
Rue, Desjoux, Villequain, Desbrosses,
and Calv&eacute;, served as volunteers. His chaplain was the Reverend
Father Onofre, and he had two surgeons, Dubois and Le Page. The last
two were probably the surgeons of Cossimbazar and Patna. He had also
with him M. Lenoir, second of Patna, whose acquaintance with the
language and the people was invaluable. Law seems to have been
always able to recruit his sepoys, but he had no great opinion of
them.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"In
fact it may be said that the sepoy is a singular</span><br

especially until he has had time to acquire a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">proper
sense of discipline. As soon as he has received his</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">red
jacket and his gun he thinks he is a different man. He</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">looks
upon himself as a European, and having a very high</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">estimation
of this qualification, he thinks he has the right to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">despise
all the country people, whom he treats as Kaffirs</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

wretched negroes, though he is often just as black as they</span><br

have less fear of the European soldier, who in</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
disorderly behaviour sometimes shows an amount of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

which they would expect in vain from a sepoy."</span><br>

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

<p>At Lucknow Suja-ud-daula greeted him with a sympathetic interest,
which Law quaintly likens to that shown by Dido for Aeneas, but
money was not forthcoming, and Law soon found that Suja-ud-daula was
not on sufficiently good terms with the Mogul's[<a name="110"></a><a
 href="#Note_110">110</a>] Vizir[<a name="111"></a><a href="#Note_111">111</a>]
at
Delhi to risk an attack on Bengal. On the 18th of October he
returned to Allahabad, with the intention of going to Delhi to see
what he could do with the Vizir, but as it might have been dangerous
to disclose his object, he pretended he was going to march south to
Bussy in the Deccan, and obtained a passport from the Maratha
general, Holkar. This took some time, and it was not till March,
1758, that he started for Delhi. He reached Farukhabad without
difficulty, and on the 21st entered the country of the Jats. On the
evening of the 23rd a barber, who came into their camp, warned the
French they would be attacked. The next day the Jats, to the number
of 20,000, attacked them on the march. The fight lasted the whole
day, and the French fired 6000 musket shots and 800 cannon. The
cannon-balls were made of clay moulded round a pebble, and were
found sufficiently effective in the level country.</p>
<p>Soon after they arrived at Delhi, only to find the Marathas masters
of the situation and in actual possession of the person of the
Shahzada, or Crown Prince.[<a name="112"></a><a href="#Note_112">112</a>]
The Prince was friendly, gave Law
money, and eagerly welcomed the idea of attacking Bengal, but he was
himself practically a prisoner. The Vizir, too, could do nothing,
and would give no money. The Marathas amused him with promises, and
tried to trap him into fighting their battles. No one seemed to know
anything about what had happened in Bengal. He spoke to several of
the chief men about the English.</p>

<p>Law could do nothing at Delhi, and it was only by bribing the
Maratha general that he obtained an escort through the Jat country
to Agra. Most of his soldiers were glad to be off, but about 60
Europeans deserted with their arms to Delhi, where the Vizir offered
them pay as high as 50 rupees a month. M. Jobard was nearly killed
by some of them when he tried to persuade them to return to duty,
but, a few months after, more than half rejoined Law.</p>
<p>From Agra, Law went to Chatrapur in Bundelkand, where apparently,
though he does not say so, he was in the service of the Raja
Indrapat. His stay lasted from the 10th of June, 1758, to February,
1759. In order to keep on good terms with the inhabitants, who were
almost all Hindus, Law forbade his men to kill cattle or any of the
sacred birds, or to borrow anything without his permission, and at
the same time severely punished all disorderly behaviour. The people
having never heard of Christians, thought the French must be a kind
of Muhammadans, but they could not make out from what country they
came. Seeing them drink a red wine of which they had a few bottles,
they thought they were drinking blood, and were horrified, but the
good behaviour of the men soon put them on friendly terms.</p>
<p>Early in 1759 the Shahzada at last invaded Bengal, and on the 5th
of February Law marched to join him; but the invasion was badly
managed, and was an absolute failure. On the 28th of May Law was
back at Chatrapur. The only result of the invasion was that the
lands of a number of Rajas in Bihar were plundered by Miran, son of
Mir Jafar, and the English. These Rajas were all Hindus.</p>

<p>In 1759 the Dutch risked a quarrel with the English. They refused,
however, any assistance from Law, who, far away as he was, heard all
about it. They were defeated at Biderra on the 25th of November. The
effect of this was to reduce Bengal to such tranquillity that Clive
considered it safe to visit England. The Shahzada, however, thought
the opportunity a favourable one for another invasion, and on the
28th of February, 1760, Law again started to join him. Patna was
besieged, and, according to Broome, was very nearly captured, owing
to Law's skill and the courage of his Frenchmen. In fact, the French
were on the ramparts, when Dr. Fullerton and the English sepoys
arrived just in time to drive them back.[<a name="113"></a><a
 href="#Note_113">113</a>]</p>
<p>The siege was raised, and the Prince's general, Kamgar Khan, led the
army about the country with apparently no object but that of
plunder. This suited the Marathas, but did not suit Law. On one
occasion he was ordered with his own troops and a body of Marathas
to capture the little fort of Soupy. The French stormed it at three
o'clock in the morning, but found that the Marathas, who had
carefully avoided the breach, had swarmed the walls, where there was
no one to oppose them, and were carrying off the plunder.</p>
<p></p>

<p>In fact, Law had a personal altercation with the Maratha commander
about a young and beautiful Hindu woman, whom the Maratha wished to
seize, but whom Law was determined to restore unhurt to her
relations, who lived in a village close by.</p>
<p>For the capture of the fort, Law received from the Shahzada various
high-sounding titles and the right to have the royal music played
before him; but as he could not afford to entertain the native
musicians, he allowed the privilege to sleep.</p>
<p>In 1760 Mr. Vansittart assumed the Governorship of Bengal, and his
first act was to complete the project begun by his predecessor, Mr.
Holwell, namely, the dethronement of Mir Jafar. This was effected on
the 20th of October, 1760; the ex-Nawab went quietly to Calcutta,
and Mir Kasim reigned in his stead. The Shahzada had now become
Emperor by the death of his father, and had assumed the title of
Shah Alam. He was still hanging with his army round Patna, and Mir
Kasim and the English determined to bring him to book. Kamgar Khan
continued to lead the Imperial army aimlessly about the country, and
in January, 1761, found himself near the town of Bihar. He had 35 to
40 thousand cavalry, maintained chiefly by plunder, but his only
musketeers and artillery were those commanded by Law, i.e. 125
Europeans and 200 sepoys, with 18 guns of small calibre. The
British commander, Major Carnac, had 650 Europeans and 5 to 6
thousand sepoys, with 12 guns. Mir Kasim had some 20,000 cavalry,
and the same number of musketeers, all good troops, for "everybody
was paid in the army of Kasim Ali Khan."[<a name="114"></a><a
 href="#Note_114">114</a>]</p>
<p>On the 14th of January, scouts brought word of the approach of the
English. The Emperor consulted Law, who advised a retreat, but he
was not deficient in courage, and determined to fight. The next day
was fought the battle of Suan.[<a name="115"></a><a href="#Note_115">115</a>]</p>

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cut
off all retreat. Then I surrendered with 3 or 4 officers</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
about 40 soldiers who were with me, and the guns. It</span><br

to resist, since it was that of the surrender of</span><br

<p>Gholam Husain Khan has left a graphic description of this incident.</p>

<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Monsieur
Law, with the small force and the artillery</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
he could muster, bravely fought the English themselves,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
for some time he made a shift to withstand their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">superiority.
Their auxiliaries consisted of large bodies of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">natives,
commanded by Ramnarain and Raj Balav, but the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">engagement
was decided by the English, who fell with so</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">much
effect upon the enemy that their onset could not be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">withstood
by either the Emperor or Kamgar Khan. The</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">latter,
finding he could not resist, turned about and fled.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">The
Emperor, obliged to follow him, quitted the field of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">battle,
and the handful of troops that followed M. Law,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">discouraged
by this flight and tired of the wandering life</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
they had hitherto led in his service, turned about</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">likewise
and followed the Emperor. M. Law, finding himself</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">abandoned
and alone, resolved not to turn his back. He</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bestrode
one of his guns and remained firm in that posture,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">waiting
the moment for his death. This being reported to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Major
Carnac, he detached himself from his main body with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Captain
Knox and some other officers, and he advanced to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
man on the gun, without taking with him either a guard</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">or
any Telingas[<a name="118"></a><a href="#Note_118">118</a>] at all.
Being arrived near, this troop</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">alighted
from their horses, and, pulling their caps from their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">heads,
they swept the air with them, as if to make him a</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><i>salam</i>;
and this salute being returned by M. Law in the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">same
manner, some parley followed in their own language.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">The
Major, after paying high encomiums to M. Law for his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">perseverance,
conduct, and bravery, added these words: 'You</span><br

  <span

done everything that could be expected from a brave</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">contending
with the English.' The other answered that, if</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">they
would accept of his surrendering himself just as he was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
had no objection, but that as to surrendering himself with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
disgrace of being without his sword, it was a shame he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">would
never submit to, and that they might take his life if</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">they
were not satisfied with that condition. The English</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">commanders,
admiring his firmness, consented to his surrendering</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">himself
in the manner he wished; after which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Major, with his officers, shook hands with him in their</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">European
manner, and every sentiment of enmity was instantly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">dismissed
on both sides. At the same time that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">commander
sent for his own <i>palky</i>, made him sit in it, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
was sent to the camp. M. Law, unwilling to see or to be</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">seen,
in that condition, shut up the curtains of the <i>palky</i> for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fear
of being recognized by any of his friends at camp, but</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">yet
some of his acquaintances, hearing of his having arrived,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">went
to him; these were Mir Abdulla and Mustapha Ali</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Khan.
The Major, who had excused him from appearing in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">public,
informed them that they could not see him for some</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">days,
as he was too much vexed to receive any company.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Ahmed
Khan Koreishi, who was an impertinent talker,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">having
come to look at him, thought to pay his court to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
English by joking on this man's defeat&#8212;a behaviour that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">has
nothing strange [in it] if we consider the times in which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">we
live and the company he was accustomed to frequent; and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it
was in that notion of his, doubtless, that with much pertness</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
voice and air he asked him this question: '<i>And Bibi</i></span><i

  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lass,</span></i><span

the officers present,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">shocked
at the impropriety of the question, reprimanded him</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
a severe look and very severe expressions. 'This man,'</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">they
said, 'has fought bravely, and deserves the attention</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
all brave men; the impertinences which you have been</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">offering
him may be customary amongst your friends and</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">your

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a
standing rule never to offer an injury to a vanquished foe.'</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Ahmed
Khan, checked by this reprimand, held his tongue,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
did not answer a word. He tarried about one hour</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">more
in his visit, and then went away much abashed; and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">although
he was a commander of importance, and one to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whom
much honour had always been paid, no one did speak</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
him any more, or made a show of standing up at his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">departure.
This reprimand did much honour to the English;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
it must be acknowledged, to the honour of those</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">strangers,
that as their conduct in war and battle is worthy</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
admiration, so, on the other hand, nothing is more modest</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
more becoming than their behaviour to an enemy,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whether
in the heat of action or in the pride of success and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">victory.
These people seem to act entirely according to the</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">rules

<p>Gholam Husain Khan says the victory was decided by the English; the
following quotation from Major Carnac's Letter to the Select
Committee at Calcutta, dated the 17th of January, 1761, shows how
the courage of the British forces saved them from a great disaster.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thus ended Law's attempt to maintain the French party in Bengal. All
hopes of a French attack in force on Calcutta had long since
disappeared, and, under the circumstances, his capture was fortunate
for himself and his comrades. Most of the latter were gradually
picked up by the English. Law was sent to Calcutta, and left Bengal
in 1762. He was now only forty-two years of age. On his arrival in
France he found his services much appreciated by his countrymen, and
was made a Chevalier of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis,
and a Colonel of Infantry. Later on he was appointed Commissary for
the King, Commandant of the French Nation in the East Indies, and
Governor of Pondicherry. Law's account of his adventures was
commenced at Paris in 1763.[<a name="121"></a><a href="#Note_121">121</a>]
There exist letters written by him
to the historian Robert Orme, dated as late as 1785, which show the
strong interest he always retained in the affairs of Bengal, where
with adequate resources he might have played a much more
distinguished part.</p>
<p>We have seen a town besieged by a foreign army; we have seen the
Court of a great Prince distracted by internal dissensions and
trembling at the approach of a too-powerful enemy, and now we shall
pass to the quiet retreats of rural Bengal, which even their
remoteness could not save from some share in the troubles of the
time. In those days, even more than at present, the rivers were the
great highways of the country, but it needs personal acquaintance
with them to enable us to realize the effect they produce upon the
mind of a European. As a rule comparatively shallow, in the dry
weather they pursue a narrow winding course in the middle of a sandy
waste, but in the Rains they fill their beds from side to side,
overtop the banks, and make the country for miles around a series of
great lakes, studded with heavily wooded islands. Amidst these one
can wander for days hardly seeing a single human being, and hearing
nothing but the rushing of the current and the weird cries of
water-birds; at other times the prow of one's boat will suddenly
push itself through overhanging branches into the very midst of a
populous village. At first all is strange and beautiful, but after a
short time the feeling grows that every scene is a repetition; the
banks, the trees, the villages, seem as if we have been looking at
them for a thousand years, and the monotony presses wearily on mind
and heart. It was in a country of this kind that Courtin and his
little band of Frenchmen and natives evaded capture for nearly nine
months, and it adds to our admiration for his character to see how
his French gaiety of heart unites with his tenderness for his absent
wife, not only to conceal the deadly monotony of his life in the
river districts during the Rains, and the depressing and
disheartening effect of the noxious climate in which he and his
companions had to dwell, but also to make light of the imminent
danger in which he stood from the unscrupulous human enemies by whom
he was surrounded.</p>

people was due not so much to their dealings with the head of the
State as to the fact that native princes generally make payments,
not in cash, but in bonds. It therefore depends on the bankers what
any man shall get for his bonds. In this way an official, even when

private persons.]</p>

speak in enigmas. It is for the great man to divine what is meant.
If he has not the wit, so much the worse for him. As a foreigner, I
was naturally more bold and said what I thought to Siraj-ud-daula.
Coja Wajid did not hesitate to blame me, so that for a long time I
did not know what to think of him. This man finally fell a victim to

have been bribed to write it in a way suitable to the views of Mr.
Watts. The Nawab never read the letters which he ordered to be
written; besides, the Moors never sign their names; the envelope
being closed and well fastened, the Secretary asks the Nawab for his
seal, and seals it in his presence. Often there is a counterfeit

<h2>M. COURTIN, CHIEF OF DACCA</h2>
<br>
<p>Jacques Ignace, son of Fran&ccedil;ois Courtin, Chevalier, Seigneur
de
Nanteuil, and of Catherine Colin, is, I believe, the correct
designation of the gentleman who appears in all the records of the
French and English East India Companies as M. Courtin, Chief of the
French Factory at Dacca.</p>
<p>In June 1756, when Siraj-ud-daula marched on Calcutta, he sent word
to his representative, the Nawab Jusserat Khan at Dacca, to seize
the English Factory, and make prisoners of the Company's servants
and soldiers. The English Factory on the site of the present
Government College, was&#8212;</p>

<p>On the 27th of June Jusserat Khan sent on the Nawab's order by the
English <i>wakil</i>, or agent, to Mr. Becher, the English Chief, and
informed him of the capture of Fort William and the flight of Mr.
Drake. Thinking this was merely a trick to frighten them into
surrender, the Dacca Council requested Mr. Scrafton, third in
Council, to write to M. Courtin, chief of the French Factory, for
information. In reply M. Courtin sent them a number of letters which
he had received from Chandernagore, confirming the bad news from
Calcutta. Taking into consideration the unfortified condition of the
Factory, and that Dacca was only four days by river from Murshidabad
whilst it was fourteen from Calcutta, it seemed idle to hope to
defend it even when assistance could be expected from the latter
place, and, now that it was certain that Calcutta itself had fallen,
any attempt at defence appeared rather "an act of rashness than of
bravery." It was therefore resolved to obtain the best terms they
could through the French.</p>
<p>The next day M. Fleurin, second of the French Factory&#8212;M.
Courtin[<a name="124"></a><a href="#Note_124">124</a>] was not well
acquainted with the English language&#8212;came
to inform them that the Nawab of Dacca agreed that the ladies and
gentlemen should be allowed to retire to the French Factory on M.
Courtin giving his word that they would there await the orders of
Siraj-ud-daula as to their future fate. The soldiers were to lay
down their arms, and be prisoners to the Nawab. This amicable
arrangement was entirely due to M. Courtin's good offices, and he
was much congratulated on the tact he had shown in preventing the
Nawab from using violent measures, as he seemed inclined to do at
first. As the Nawab would not allow the English to take away any of
their property, except the clothes they were wearing, they were
entirely dependent upon the French for everything, and were treated
with the greatest kindness. The Council wrote:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
French have behaved with the greatest humanity</span><br

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>For some two months the English remained in the French Factory, M.
Law, at Cossimbazar, warmly soliciting their release from
Siraj-ud-daula. This he obtained with difficulty, and at last Mr.
Becher and his companions sailed in a sloop provided by M. Courtin
for Fulta, where they arrived safely on the 26th of August. When
Calcutta had been recaptured by the English, M. Courtin, like a good
business man, sent in a bill for the costs of the sloop to the
Council at Calcutta, and the Consultations of the 16th of May, 1757,
duly notify its payment.</p>
<p>The English did not regain possession of the Factory at Dacca till
the 8th of March, by which time the declaration of War between
France and England was known, and the likelihood of troubles in
Bengal was very apparent. As we have seen, the English were
successful in their attack on Chandernagore, but the whole country
was aware that the Nawab was only the more enraged with them, and
his local officers might at any moment be instructed to take
vengeance on Englishmen found defenceless up country. On the 23rd of
March, Messrs. Sumner and Waller wrote from Dacca that Jusserat Khan
had refused to restore the Factory cannon, and to pass their goods
without a new <i>parwana</i>[<a name="125"></a><a href="#Note_125">125</a>]
from Murshidabad. It was therefore
still very doubtful whether he would assist the English or the
French at Dacca, and though the English obtained the <i>parwana</i>
they
wanted early in May, on the 9th the Council at Calcutta sent them
orders to do the best they could for their own security, and
informed them they had sent an armed sloop to Luckipore to cover
their retreat. They immediately sent down all the goods they could,
but as matters became quieter again they soon resumed business, and
appear to have had no further trouble.</p>
<p>It may be imagined that M. Courtin and his friends, knowing that the
English had demanded the surrender of the French Factories, had a
very uncomfortable experience all this time.[<a name="126"></a><a
 href="#Note_126">126</a>] Unfortunately no
Records of the French Factories in Bengal are now to be found, and I
had despaired of obtaining any information about the expulsion from
Dacca, when, in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris, I came on a
MS.
entitled, "<i>Copy of a letter from M. Courtin from India, written to
his wife, in which are given in detail the different affairs which
he had with the Moors from the 22nd of June, 1757, the day of his
evacuation of Dacca, to the 9th of March, 1758</i>."[<a name="127"></a><a

<p>M. Courtin had married a Madame Direy, widow of a French Company's
servant, and the letter shows she was fortunately in France at the
time of her husband's troubles. As was natural, but inconveniently
enough for us, Courtin does not think it necessary to trouble her
with unintelligible and unpronounceable Indian names. Where
possible, I shall fill them in from the English Records, otherwise I
shall interrupt the course of the letter as little as possible. It

when once they found themselves on a good road; but</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">unfortunately
we were an obstacle in the way of their</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">vengeance,
otherwise I believe they would have observed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
neutrality which had been always so carefully maintained</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">by
the European nations in the country of the Ganges, in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">spite
of all the wars which took place in Europe. Many of</span><br

French from Chandernagore&#8212;officers, Company's servants,</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">who
formed there a party which opposed the English in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">various
ways. The English, however, forced Siraj-ud-daula,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">against
his true interest and in spite of his promise to</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">protect
us, to abandon us, and to make M. Law leave his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Factory
and go to Patna. This imprudent act was the ruin</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
the Prince and put the final touch to our misfortunes,</span><br

it has made the English masters of Bengal, and has</span><br

little as was possible in such circumstances, owing, I</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
had rendered them in Dacca the year before. I had all</span><br

to secure to me all my effects and merchandise in</span><br

over to them the French Factory and all that belonged</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
the Company, and would myself leave for Pondicherry</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
the following October. They said I should not be considered</span><br

prisoner of war, and should not require to be</span><br

eyes, and without doubt in those of all the world. I</span><br

thought it my duty to reject them.</span><br

were on this footing when, at the beginning</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of

were marching upon Murshidabad with all their forces</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
achieve the destruction of a Prince who was already half</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">ruined
by his own timidity and cowardice, and still further</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">weakened
by the factions formed against him by the chief</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">members
of his own family&#8212;a Prince detested by every one</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for
his pride and tyranny, and for a thousand dreadful crimes</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
which he had already soiled his reputation though he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
barely twenty-five years old.</span><br

knew only too well what was preparing against him,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
I was also most eager to find some honourable means of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">escape
for myself. M. Chevalier's absence troubled me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">greatly,
and I did not like to leave him behind me. At last</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
arrived on the 16th or 17th. I had taken the precaution</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
provide myself with a <i>parwana</i>, or passport, signed by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Siraj-ud-daula,
allowing me to go where I pleased. That</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Prince
had recalled M. Law to him, but too late, for I felt</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">certain
he could not rejoin him in time to save him or to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">check
the progress of his enemies. I was in a hurry therefore</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
go and help to save him if that were possible, taking</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">care,
however, to choose a route by which I could escape if,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">as
I thought probable, he should have succumbed beforehand</span><br

the efforts of the English, and the treason of his subjects.</span><br

route in this direction, but found myself suddenly and</span><br

<p>Courtin is somewhat unfair to the Raja (apparently a Muhammadan, as
he was called Assaduzama Muhammad),[<a name="136"></a><a
 href="#Note_136">136</a>] for this Prince was an ally
of the English, and had offered Clive the assistance of his forces
before the battle of Plassey. It could be no treachery on his part
to pick up fugitives from the battle, like Sinfray, and hand them
over to his allies. I may as well quote one of the Raja's letters to
Clive, received 28th October, 1757:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>

  <span

there; but I was prevented by the murmurs of my people,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">especially
the boatmen, who already began to desert in small</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">parties.
Accordingly I accepted an offer made me on the</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">part
of the Raja of Sahibgunj, to give me a site for a fort,</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to aid me with everything I might want. I descended</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
river bank, I commenced a fort, but the thickness of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">forest
forced me to abandon it, and I entered a little river</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">close
by, which conducted me to a marsh, on the borders of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
I found an elevated site admirably situated and in a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">very

This belonged to the same</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Raja,
and with his consent I again set to work, and that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

such promptitude that in less than a month my fortress</span><br

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">commenced
to take form, and visibly progressed owing to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
extraordinary efforts I made to complete it. It was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">triangular,
with a bastion at each angle. At two of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">angles
I had found superb trees with very heavy foliage, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">on
the third I erected the mast of my boat and hoisted our</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">flag.
All three bastions had four embrasures, a fine entrance</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">gate
opening on the marsh, and a little open turret above,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

small entrance gate led to the open country. The curtains</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

carefully pierced for musketry, and strengthened outside</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
a trellis work of bamboo, and finished off with banquettes</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

the ramparts. An excellent powder magazine</span><br

built in the same way, and, being situated in the interior</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of

our ramparts two Swedish guns, which afterwards proved</span><br

<p>From Broome we see that this was in the middle of December, 1757. It
was now that Clive first heard what Courtin was attempting. He
immediately sent orders direct, and also through the Nawab, to Kasim
Ali Khan, Faujdar of Rungpore, and to Raja Ram Nath of Dinajpur, to
seize the French.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"It was almost impossible for me to
reascend the river</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">because of the dry banks and the
strong currents which</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">would have put my boats in danger.
However, I found</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">myself in the country of Rungpore,
which was a dependency</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of Bengal. I determined
nevertheless to remain where I</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">was, flattering myself the English
would not come to look</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">for me, nor the Nawab or the ruler
of the province think of</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">disturbing themselves about me, as
I was doing no harm in</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the country, and as I was very
strict in observing proper</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">order and discipline. I was so
confident on this latter head</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">that I did not think of throwing up
now entrenchments, and</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">occupied myself only with hunting
and walking whilst I</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">awaited the arrival of the French
forces. However, one day,</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">towards the middle of January, a
secret rumour came to me</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">that Kasim Ali Khan, Faujdar of
Rungpore, was coming to</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">attack me. I sent out scouts, who
reported that all was</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">tranquil in his town, and that, far
from wishing to come and</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">look for a quarrel, he was in fear
lest I should march against</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">his town, which was three days'
journey from where I was.</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Doubtless my men deceived me or did
not take the trouble</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">to go to Rungpore, for on the 15th
of the same month, at</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3 p.m., on the opposite side of the
river to that on which</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">we were, there appeared a body of
soldiers, cavalry and</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">infantry, about 600 in number, who
approached so near my</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">fleet that I no longer doubted the
correctness of the first</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">advice which had been given me. I
ordered a discharge</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of three guns on this troop, which
was so well directed that</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the enemy were forced to take
themselves off and to encamp</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">a little further from me. Next day
the commander sent me</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">a present of some fruit, and an
intimation that he only</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">wished to see me quit his country.
He knew I could not</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">do this without risk, and,
according to the custom of the</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">infidels, he gave me the strongest
possible assurances of my</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">safety and tranquillity. I took
care not to trust to them;</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I was then, as I said above,
without entrenchments and</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">without defence, so in the evening
I set to work at surrounding</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">myself with a ditch, the mud taken
out of which would</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">serve me for embrasures. I was
short of provisions, which</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">made me very anxious, and I was
still more so when</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I learned that the enemy were
trying to cut me off from</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">provisions on all sides, and that
their intention was to</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">capture me by famine or treachery.
Their number quickly</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">increased to 3000 men, of whom a
part came over to my</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">side of the river, and harassed my
people whenever they</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">went out for provisions. This
forced me to detach. MM.</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Chevalier and Gourlade, with about
10 men, some peons</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and boatmen, against one of their
little camps, where there</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">were about 150 men, foot and horse.
Our men received</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">their fire, stormed the camp, and
destroyed it after having</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">put every one to flight. There was
not a single person</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">wounded on our side. This little
advantage gave me time to</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">make a good provision of rice and
other things in the villages</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">near my entrenchments. I cleared
out these villages and</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">drove out the inhabitants, but I
was still in need of a</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">quantity of things necessary to
life. To procure these, I</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">tried to frighten the enemy by
cannonading their chief camp</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">on the other side of the river.
This only resulted in making</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">them withdraw altogether beyond the
reach of my guns, not</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">with the idea of going away, but of
starving me out, and, as</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I learned later, to give time for a
reinforcement of artillery</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">which they were expecting to
arrive. They had already 4</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">or 5 guns, but their calibre was
small compared with mine,</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">as I was able to see from the balls
which fell in my camp</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">when it was entrenched only on the
land side.</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"The 19th of January, early in the
morning, I sent across</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the river a number of workmen,
supported by a little detachment</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">under M. Gourlade, to cut down a
grove of bamboos</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">which masked my guns, and to burn
down some houses which</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">were also in their way. I forbade
them to engage the enemy,</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and all went well until some
topasses and peons advanced</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">too far towards the enemy's camp,
and I heard discharges</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">so loud and frequent on both sides,
that I ordered a retreat</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">to be beaten in my entrenchments,
to make my people recross</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the river. I fired my guns
continually to facilitate this and to</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">cover the movement. In this
skirmish I had only one soldier</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">wounded, and I do not know whether
the enemy had any</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">losses. This day more than 1500
shots were fired on both</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">sides. Some of the guns which the
enemy brought up</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">troubled us greatly, as we were not
entrenched on the water</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">side. Several balls fell at my side
or passed over my head.</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This determined me to set all my
people at work the next</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">night with torches, to put us under
cover on this side</span><br>
  <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">also."</span><br>

a single shot to be fired with musket or cannon, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">simply
recommended my people to be on their guard on</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
land side. The enemy kept up a continuous and very</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">lively
fire until 4 o'clock in the evening. I considered that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it
would be useless for me to reply, and wished to see how far</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">they
would push their insolence. That day we picked up 40</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cannon-balls,
and our whole loss was one boatman slightly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">wounded
in the leg. From 4 o'clock till night the enemy's</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">fire
was continued, but at long intervals. It began again</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
next morning. I suffered this as on the previous day</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for
a couple of hours, at the end of which. I fired several</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">shots
and silenced it. My firing seemed to trouble the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">enemy
more than I expected it would. One of my boats was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">sunk
by a cannon-ball, several were pierced through, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
  <i>rezai</i>, which used to serve me as a coat, was much</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">damaged.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"The
succeeding days passed much in the same manner</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">until
the 3rd of February, when, on the same bank and to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
north above my fleet, I saw a new entrenchment, which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
been thrown up during the preceding night. Its batteries</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">enfiladed
mine along their whole length. It was necessary</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">either
to risk everything by making a sortie in order to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">destroy
it, or to arrange terms. I determined on the latter,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
appeared to me all the more necessary, as I was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">beginning
to be in want of everything, and as I had just</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">received
letters which deprived me of all hope of the arrival</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of
our forces in Bengal until April or May. I therefore</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">informed
Sheikh Faiz Ulla that I was ready to enter upon</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">negotiations,
and the same day he sent me some of his people,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
whom I agreed to leave my entrenchments and go</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">down
the river. I consented to do this without hostages,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">but,
that it might be done in security, I promised them a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">sum
of money for themselves as well as for their general.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">This
arrangement being agreed to by Sheikh Faiz Ulla, he</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">sent
me word that, in order that he might not appear to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">betray
his master, it would be necessary for me next morning</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
open the fiercest fire possible on his camp; that he would</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">reply;
that on both sides it should be with the intention of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">doing
as little hurt as possible; that I should pretend it was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
force him to give me a passport, which he would send me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
the evening; and that I should then send him the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">money
I had promised. All these precautions were only</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
assist his rascality, and they appeared to me all the more</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">surprising,
as he had already repeatedly informed me that</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">he
had his master's permission to give me a passport, and to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">let
me go where I pleased. But of what are these Moors not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">capable?
Without being blind to the continuance of his perfidy,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
flattered myself that it might happen that he would not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">trouble
me on my march when he had received my money.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"However
this might be, my cannon fired from 10 in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
morning till 3 in the evening. Our people, perceiving</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
the enemy were firing in earnest, did not spare them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">any
more than they spared us, and that which was at first,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">on
our side, only a pretence, finally became serious. At 4</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">o'clock
I received an envoy, who brought me the passport,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to whom I paid the money. He assured me that I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">might
embark my artillery the next morning, and set out the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">day
after without the slightest apprehension of being interfered</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with,
I took my precautions, and, in fear of treachery, kept</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">on
shore my two Swedish guns. At last, at seven in the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">morning,
my boats started, having on board only the sick</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
helpless, and I set out by land with my two guns and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

rest of my troop, at the head of which I put myself."</span><br>

<p>This triumph of time and treachery was reported by Sheikh Faiz

<p>About this time, though Courtin does not mention it till later, he
began to see what the inevitable end must be. He could not cut his
way through to join Law, and with the whole country in arms against
him he was too weak to hold out for any length of time. Accordingly
he sent messengers secretly to Mr. Luke Scrafton, at Murshidabad. It
was Scrafton, as I have said above, who wrote to Courtin for
assistance when the Nawab of Dacca wanted to take their Factory and
imprison the English. Courtin now wrote to him to save him from
falling into the hands of the natives, and, on the 18th of February,
Scrafton wrote to the Select Committee at Calcutta for the necessary
permission.[<a name="150"></a><a href="#Note_150">150</a>]</p>

was my surprise, at the end of an hour and a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">half,
to see that we were followed by a body of four or five</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">hundred
men, with two guns drawn by oxen. I pretended</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">not
to notice, and continued my march, but at 3 o'clock</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
the afternoon, seeing this troop approach, within range of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
pieces, I pointed them at the Moors, and put my force</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
a position of defence. Their rascality followed its usual</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">course,
and they sent me word that I had nothing to fear,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
they would not march so close to me any more, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
they followed me only to preserve the peace and to</span><br

disorder. I received this excuse for what it was worth,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
pretended to be content with, it, seeing clearly that they</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">were
looking for an opportunity to surprise and destroy us.</span><br

accidents happening to the boats of the rearguard</span><br

my troop and myself from rejoining the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">main
body of the fleet till far on in the night. I found it</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">anchored
in the most disadvantageous position possible, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
the morning I saw at a distance of one-eighth of a league</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
same body of troops, that had followed me the day before,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">establishing
and settling itself. A moment later I learned</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
Sheikh Faiz Ulla was on the opposite bank with his</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">army
and his artillery, that he intended to wait for me in a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">narrow
place called Choquova,[<a name="151"></a><a href="#Note_151">151</a>]
at the foot of which my boats</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">must
pass, and that he was diligently making entrenchments</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">there.
My embarrassment was then extreme. I found</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">myself
surrounded on all sides; I was without any provisions,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">destitute
of the most necessary articles of life. In</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">this
perplexity I saw only the most cruel alternatives, either</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
surrender or to fight to the death so as to perish with our</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">arms
in our hands. The latter appeared to be less dreadful</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">than
the former.</span><br

repeated consultations, we determined it would</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">be
best to risk the passage of the fleet by Choquova. We</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">thought
that possibly we should find provisions there, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

certainly the position could not be worse (for defence)</span><br

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">disorder,
by means of my Swedish guns on the boat which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">led
the van. What was our delight to find, not only a better</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">position
than that which we had quitted, but one that was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">almost
completely entrenched by nature, and had villages</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">full
of rice to the right and left of it.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Next
day I collected provisions in abundance, cleared</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
country round for a quarter of a league, and did my best</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
ameliorate my condition. The enemy were disconcerted by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
boldness. They pretended as usual, in order to deceive</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
the more easily, that they were not surprised at my march.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">They
feared rightly that if I commenced new entrenchments</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">all
their trouble would begin again. Besides, I had completely</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">protected
myself from the possibility of surprise. <i>Pourparlers</i></span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for
an accommodation were renewed and lasted three</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">days,
at the end of which it was agreed that I should</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">continue
my march, that two hostages should be given me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for
my safety, and that the army with its guns should retire</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">from
Choquova, and should be sent a long way ahead across</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">country,
and as, at half a league from this place, the river</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
no longer navigable because of the bank which had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">formed
in it, I should be supplied with people to facilitate</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
passage. Thou wilt notice, my dear wife, that in all the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">negotiations
I had for various reasons and on several occasions</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">proposed
to suspend all hostilities until an answer</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">could
be received from Jafar All Khan and the English, to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whom
I said I would write to come to some accommodation</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
them, offering to send my letter open. This was repeatedly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">refused,
but the refusal did not prevent my asking</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for
the honours of war. My letters were despatched secretly</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">by
my own messengers.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"At
last, on the 23rd, I quitted, though with regret</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">(always
expecting treachery), my new position, and approached</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
shallow or bank mentioned. It was night when I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">arrived.
In spite of this I could understand, from the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">dreadful
noise made by the waters, that I should have</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">difficulty
in traversing this dangerous passage even with the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">assistance
promised me. I was only too well convinced of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
truth of this when day broke, and I saw that I had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">again
been betrayed. There was nothing to be seen of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">work
which the Moors had engaged to do to lessen the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">difficulty
of the passage. However, I did not hesitate to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">put
out with my lighter boats, firmly resolved, if they arrived</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">safely,
to sacrifice the larger, with all that was upon them,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
my safety, and thus to effect my retreat during the night.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">With
the exception of two, which were lost, they all arrived</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">safely.
During this piece of work, which took up the whole</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">day,
I dissimulated my intentions in the presence of my hostages,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">merely
letting them see I was somewhat surprised to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">find
that, contrary to the promise given, there were no workmen,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">but
that the army, which ought to have been withdrawn,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">was
still close to us. Their excuses were vague and unsatisfactory.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">One
of them, who, no doubt, knew the enemy's plans,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">asked
permission to go to their camp, promising to come</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">back
the next day. Though his demand accorded with my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">designs,
I agreed to it only after much persuasion, warning</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">him
not to break his <i>parole</i> to return the next morning very</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">early.
This he swore to do. As a rule these people think</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">nothing
of an oath. I did not intend to wait for him, which</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
comrade clearly perceived, for, seeing that he himself</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
been sacrificed by his master's perfidy, he approved of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
resolution I had taken to set out by night, and swore</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
he had acted in good faith, and was ignorant of the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">treachery
that had been concocted. 'You can,' he said to me,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">'have
my throat cut. You would be justified in doing so;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">but
I will not quit you, even if you give me permission.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">If
I went to my own people, they would say that I had</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">disclosed
to you the trick which you have yourself discovered,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
would certainly show me less mercy than I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">have
experienced from you.' After this I contented myself</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
having him closely watched.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"Orders
being given to the remaining boats to start by</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">night,
I mounted on horseback to carry certain necessaries</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
my detachment on land, which was already a little in</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">advance
and had crossed a small river with the guns. I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
only three blacks with me, and none of us knew the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">way.
The night was dark, and we wandered from it. I</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">narrowly
escaped being drowned with my horse, and at last</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">we
lost ourselves entirely. If we had been met by any</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">horsemen,
nothing would have been easier than for them to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">capture
me, our arms and cartridges being all soaked with</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">water.
Luckily I heard our drums beating, and this told us</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
what direction we could safely go.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"My
intention was to march by land with my troops and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">guns.
They objected to this, as I was wet to the skin and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">had
a cold on the chest, which hardly allowed me to speak;</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">so
I went back to the boats, though with much regret, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">resolved
to manage so as not to lose sight of my detachment.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
was in constant anxiety about the latter till 8 o'clock the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">next
day, when we all came together, except one soldier</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">topass,
who, by his own fault, had remained on a big boat</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
we had abandoned, and a <i>manjhi</i>,[<a name="152"></a><a
 href="#Note_152">152</a>] who was drowned</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
one of the two little ones which had sunk.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

myself in the territory of the Raja of Dinajpur,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
imagined I had nothing to do with any one except him, and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that
Sheikh Faiz Ulla and his army would not think of</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">following
me through a country which, though tributary to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Nawab of Bengal, still in no way belonged to Faiz Ulla's</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">master.
The hostage who remained with me, and to whom</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
spoke about the matter,[<a name="153"></a><a href="#Note_153">153</a>]
did not altogether dissuade me</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">from
this idea, but counselled me to continue my march</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
to get farther away, which I did till 6 o'clock in the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">evening.
What was my surprise when, at 9 o'clock, my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">scouts
reported that the enemy were pursuing me, and were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">not
more than a league away at the most. I could not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">advance
during the night for fear of running on the banks</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">or
shallows with which the river was filled, and which might</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cause
the loss of my boats and of my people. Accordingly,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
did not set out till the morning, and always remained</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">myself
in the rear (of the fleet). I had stopped to wait for</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
land detachment and the guns, and was at some distance</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">from
the rest of my little fleet, when, about half-past nine,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
heard several musket shots fired. In an instant I was</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">surrounded
by the enemy. M. Chevalier, who conducted the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">land
detachment, fortunately perceived my situation, and,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">seeing
my danger, brought up the two guns and fired about</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">20
shots, which disengaged me, and gave me time to regain</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
boats by swift rowing. I had with me only Pedro and</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
Moorish hostage mentioned before. Then I landed with</span><br

  <span

enough to defend himself. At the same time I ordered</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
boats to go on. In this skirmish our loss was only one</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">man
slightly wounded in the ear by a musket-ball.</span><br

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">boats.
At the end of an hour the boatmen abandoned them</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">in
a sudden panic, and hurried tumultuously to join me.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">When
my people were collected, I would have tried to go</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
recapture my boats, which the enemy had not delayed</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
seize; but not only would this have been a rash undertaking</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

so small a force against 3000 men, but also</span><br

  <span

was a little river which formed an island between my</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">boats
and me, and so prevented the passage of my guns</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">This
determined me to abandon the boats, and to retreat to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Dinajpur,
where I hoped to find an asylum with the Raja</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whilst
I waited for a reply to my letters to Jafar All Khan</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">and
the English. We marched till 1 o'clock in the afternoon</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">without

this time Sheikh Faiz Ulla and his people were</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">occupied
in plundering the boats. We were now not very</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">far
from Dinajpur, when we met a body of the Raja's cavalry,</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">the
commander of which begged me to take another road so</span><br

not to pass through his town. Accordingly he gave me</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a
guide, with whom we marched till half-past five, when we</span><br

  <span

<p>This was the battle of Cantanagar. Kasim Ali described it as follows
to Clive:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><span

<p>About the time he was writing this, Clive was writing to say that he
had received Courtin's offer of surrender, and that Kasim Ali was to
cease hostilities and allow the French to come to him with their
boats and necessaries. Kasim Ali had received orders to the same
effect from Mr. Scrafton, who informed him he was sending an officer
to accept their surrender. This did not however prevent Kasim Ali
from trying to get hold of them, which accounts for the following
letter from Raja Ram Nath to Clive:[<a name="155"></a><a

favour which he had shown to us. Fear was the only</span><br

the wiser, as I was informed that nothing would induce</span><br

open country or the escort offered by the Raja, as his</span><br

 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">men
were subordinate to the same Prince as the people who</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">composed
the army of Sheikh Faiz Ulla, and were likely</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">enough
to abandon me or to join my enemies in overwhelming</span><br

My conjectures were well founded, as, several days</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">after,
this same Raja, prompted by Sheikh Faiz Ulla, sent</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
word that he could not answer for what might happen to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">me
if I were attacked; that his troops, being subject to</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Murshidabad
like those of Kasim All Khan, could not</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">support
me, nor fire on the latter. Finally he sent a certain</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">priest
of his faith, a grave man, who came to suggest to us</span><br

our best course was to leave Dinajpur and gain the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">open
country, otherwise we were lost. He said that he</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">knew
for certain that if I were so obstinate as to persist in</span><br

to remain there, orders had been given to attack us,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cut
our throats, and send our heads to Murshidabad. This</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">person

dying with fright lest war should be made in the very</span><br

against any one who attacked me, to set fire to</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">everything
I found within my reach, to kill as many people</span><br

I could, and to die on my guns when I had used up all</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">my
ammunition; that this was also the intention of my companions,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">who
preferred to die thus, like brave men, rather than</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
be exposed to the ignominies and indignities that we should</span><br

  <span

parties, found himself in the utmost embarrassment, for</span><br

  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Sheikh
Faiz Ulla, at the gates of his town, put, as it were,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">his
country under contribution, and demanded from him,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">with
all imaginable insolence, that he should deliver us up</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">to
him, a thing which the Raja found difficult to do.</span><span

&nbsp;"Some days passed in this way, during which we had</span><span

&nbsp;frequent alarms, but the letters I received from Murshidabad</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;filled every one with perplexity. The English sent me</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;people on their own account. One of my private friends,[<a

 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <br>
&nbsp;whom I had been so fortunate as to oblige on a similar</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;occasion, wrote me not to trouble myself about my boats or</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;my effects, but to come at once to him, and he would see</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;that they restored or paid for my property, and that they</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;gave me all that I might need. The orders received by</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <br>
&nbsp;Sheikh Faiz Ulla and the Raja at the same time, ordered the</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;one to leave me in peace and the other to furnish me with</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;everything I wanted. This put my mind in a condition of</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;serenity to which it had long been a stranger, and threw my</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;enemies into much confusion. They proposed that I should</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;resume possession of my boats. I knew, with absolute</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <br>
&nbsp;certainty, that they had been half looted, still I accepted</span><span
 style="margin-left: 1em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;them on condition they were brought to Dinajpur. They</span><span

&nbsp;managed to let it off, and sent
a bullet through my left<br>

&nbsp;the bullet first struck; still it passed almost
completely<br>
&nbsp;through the shoulder and lodged under the skin, which had<br>
&nbsp;to be opened behind the shoulder to extract it and also the<br>

<p>One would be glad to be assured that Courtin re-established his
fortune. If he is, as I suppose, the Jacques Ignace Courtin, who was
afterwards <i>Conseiller au Conseil des Indes</i>, we may be satisfied
he
did so; but French East India Company Records are a hopeless chaos
at the present moment, and all that one can extract from the English
Records is evidence of still further suffering.</p>
<p>From Murshidabad or Cossimbazar, Courtin went down to Chandernagore,
whence the majority of the French inhabitants had already been sent
to the Madras Coast. The Fort had been blown up, and the private
houses were under sentence of destruction, for the English had
determined to destroy the town, partly in revenge for the behaviour
of Lally, who, acting under instructions from the French East India
Company, had shown great severity to the English in Southern India,
partly because they did not think themselves strong enough to
garrison Chandernagore as well as Calcutta, and feared the Moors
would occupy it if they did not place troops there, and partly
because they dreaded its restoration to France&#8212;which actually
happened&#8212;when peace was made. At any rate Courtin found the
remnants of his countrymen in despair, and in 1759 he wrote a
letter[<a name="168"></a><a href="#Note_168">168</a>] to Clive and the
Council of Calcutta, from which I
quote one or two paragraphs:&#8212;</p>

<p>The last words seem to imply that Courtin had recovered his
property, at least to a great extent; but his pathetic appeal was
useless in face of national necessities, and so far was
Chandernagore desolated that, in November of the same year, we read
that the English army, under Colonel Forde, was ambushed by the
Dutch garrison of Chinsurah "amongst the buildings and ruins of
Chandernagore."</p>
<p>From Chandernagore Courtin went to Pondicherry, where he became a
member of the Superior Council. He was one of the chiefs of the
faction opposed to Lally, who contemptuously mentions a printed
"Memorial" of his adventures which Courtin prepared, probably for
presentation to the Directors of the French East India Company.[<a
 name="169"></a><a href="#Note_169">169</a>]
When, in January, 1761, Lally determined to capitulate, Courtin was
sent to the English commander on the part of the Council. Still
later we find his name attached to a petition, dated August 3, 1762,
presented to the King against Lally.[<a name="170"></a><a
 href="#Note_170">170</a>] This shows that Courtin
had arrived in France, so that his elevation to the Council of the
Company is by no means improbable.</p>
<p>To any one who has lived long in India it seems unnatural that in
old days the small colonies of Europeans settled there should have
been incited to mutual conflict and mutual ruin, owing to quarrels
which originated in far-off Europe, and <i>which were decided without
any reference to the wishes or interests of Europeans living in the
colonies</i>. The British Settlements alone have successfully survived
the struggle. The least we can do is to acknowledge the merits,
whilst we commiserate the sufferings, of those other gallant men who
strove their best to win the great prize for their own countrymen.
Of the French especially it would appear that their writers have
noticed only those like Dupleix, Bussy, and Lally, who commanded
armies in glorious campaigns that somehow always ended to the
advantage of the British, and have utterly forgotten the civilians
who really kept the game going, and who would have been twice as
formidable to their enemies if the military had been subordinate to
them. The curse of the French East India Company was Militarism,
whilst fortunately for the English our greatest military hero in
India, Lord Clive, was so clear-minded that he could write:&#8212;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span
 style="margin-left: 0.5em; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"I

 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

my nature, that I would have the Civil all in all,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <span

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>How much might have been achieved by men like Renault, Law, and
Courtin, if they had had an adequate military force at their
disposal! They saw, as clearly as did the English, that Bengal was
the heart of India, and they saw the English denude Madras of troops
to defend Bengal, whilst they themselves were left by the French
commanders in a state of hopeless impotence. On the other hand,
owing to the English Company's insistence that military domination
should be the exception and not the rule, British civilians and
British soldiers have, almost always, worked together harmoniously.
It was this union of force which gave us Bengal in the time of which
I have been writing, and to the same source of power we owe the
gradual building up of the great Empire which now dominates the
whole of India.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
